            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>The <hi>Preface, Introduction,</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</head>
               <p>THE nature and compoſition of mankind; like that Voice which was heard in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being a warning to its Officers, and a Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick of its ruine, cryes aloud that we muſt depart hence; and ſince our abode in this World is a ſtate of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and our life here is in order to another; ſince we are a ſufficient demonſtration to our ſelves, that we were not ſo wonderfully made, to have our beings expire with our breath, but the frame and actions of the reaſonable ſoul loudly proclaim its one immortality, and that death proves a change only, not annihilation; 'Tis rational for men to employ their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36404:5"/>thoughts how to be ſecured of an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate when they ſhall be remov'd from their ſtation here, to abandon this World, which endures but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to make proviſion for a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſhall laſt as long as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can meaſure it. Now ſince there is nothing more likely to intereſt us in the happineſs of the Regions above, than obedience to him who has them in his diſpoſal; it is ſuitable to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and inference of men, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into his ſervice, and be guided by the declarations of his will, ſince he has exhibited his Laws to the World: This puts us upon the exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and brings us under the conduct of his government. And becauſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably dangerous is a miſcarriage in this affair, admitting no reverſe after death, nor can the thread of our lives be new ſpun when our common fate has ſnapp'd it aſunder; our fear of error cautions us to be wary, that we may chuſe well, and neither incline to the temptations of the fleſh, nor be led aſide by the allurements of the World, or the ſecret inſinuations of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which like roaring Lions, <hi>walk up and down, ſeeking whom they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36404:5"/>from hence we ſee the neceſſity of diligence, as well to underſtand the Laws of our Maker, as to avoid their violation, which though ſometimes it grows peccant by being over-curious, when the paſſion of fear conquers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and inclines men to ſuperſtition: yet more miſtakes are frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted when we relax our diligence, from miſapprehenſions of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will, and on a ſudden grow confident and preſume; inferring from our uncertain notions of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, that duty and devotion are not abſolutely neceſſary for the obtainment of the end of our hope, the ſalvation of our ſouls, ſince Gods decrees are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, and the predeſtinate ſhall be ſaved let them do what they will, and the reprobates ſhall be damned let them do what they can. I ſhall not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew how inconſiſtent ſuch poſitions are with the nature of God, the liberty of men, or the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the community: But this will appear moſt reaſonable, that the Being of a God once granted, and that he contains all poſſible perfection; his worſhip and adoration will be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inference, and if he be our Maker
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36404:6"/>and Benefactor, there is reaſon that we ſhould petition and give him thanks: For not to be grateful is inhumane, and not to begg his favour on whom we depend, is fooliſh and irrational; nay, worſe than ſo; for the Beaſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will condemn this, whoſe actions are to us diſcourſe, and their ſence of obligation arguments to convince us. The devouring Lion is obſequious to his keeper, the dull Ox knoweth his owner, and the ſluggiſh Aſs, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable creature, his Maſters crib. It would be ſtrange then, if reaſonable men ſhould not both know their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and conſider their duty: Goodneſs is uſually ſo attractive to the will, eſpecially that which is diffuſive in courteſies, that from bad natures, it frequently commands both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement and returns: Where this therefore has ſhone bright, warming a Chaos into an orderly Creation, and brought us forth to be ſubordinate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours over the works of Gods hands. 'Tis no wonder that it enlightens us to a ſenſe of duty, and heats our zeal to worſhip and adore; ſince we cannot chuſe but pay our eſteem (unleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice checks ingenuity) to men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36404:6"/>our ſelves ſuitable to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies inherent in them. Thus far, I ſuppoſe, mankind are agreed; and I may modeſtly challenge the univerſal vogue to vouch the aſſertion.</p>
               <p>But now the thoughts of men will differ, and temperament or intereſt will ſway their minds with reference to the modes of addreſs; For the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of men being oftentimes as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as their complexions, and the ſentiments and diſpoſitions of the mind being very ſervile in attending upon the temperament of the body, (beſides the power of cuſtom and education) it is very difficult to diſentangle the ſoul from thoſe fetters in which preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice has chained it, that it may be free in its inferences and concluſions. Hence is it that though we all agree upon the Being of a God, and that adoration and worſhip are due to him; Yet the acts compounding, and the ceremonies attending it, have raiſed ſo many Schiſms and Contentions among men, that they ſeem to agree in nothing but reſolutions always to differ. That we may ſay therefore to theſe winds, be ſtill, and rebuke the ſtorms which diſturb the world, that ſome ſerenity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36404:7"/>may at laſt appear when the clouds are ſcattered; I have taken the ſubject of Prayer to diſcourſe on, it being a duty that ought to attend the courſe of our lives, to which our own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities prompt us, our dependance upon God reaſonably requires, and his command renders it indiſpenſible. But yet becauſe the variety of mens apprehenſions and intereſts, which controvert every thing, have perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, I would willingly be as inſtrumental as I can in ſetling your minds in a point of ſuch univerſal concernment, (eſpecally at this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated time of Lent, in which our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick devotions are more frequent, and with a greater ſolemnity injoyned and praictis'd, accompanied with faſting and Alms-giving, thoſe mighty reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our ſelves, and eſtates, as ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices well pleaſing unto God.) And therefore I ſhall endeavour (1.) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this duty, (2.) draw ſome infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In the explication I ſhall ſhew you theſe ſeven things.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36404:7"/>Writ, which ſeem to ſet forth this duty of Prayer, as if it were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without interruption.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is the object of our Prayers, or to whom we ought to make this religious addreſs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In what manner we ought to pray. And this (1.) in relation to the intentions of our minds; (2.) with reference to the geſture of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; (3.) in relation to words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, For what we may lawfully, and ought to pray; and this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar will involve perſons and things.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whether this duty of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is injoyned ſo, that it is expected from all men, or only ſuch as are good and vertuous.</p>
               <p>And, Laſtly, I ſhall conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo neceſſary or no; ſince God already knows our wants, and we cannot break the links that chain cauſes to effects, nor alter the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties decrees or providence by any of our wiſhes or Prayers.</p>
               <p>From the ſtating and reſolution of which particulars, I ſhall at laſt infer three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſervice or prayers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36404:8"/>of our own Church are ſo framed and performed, that God does accept them, and are a proper method of addreſſing to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is moſt irrational, and abominably peccant in hers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That ſuch as live among our ſelves, and yet ſeparate from us under the pretence of greater Reformation, and a more Pure and Evangelical wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, do not perform their ſervices to God in ſuch manner as is ſuitable to his Attributes, mans dependence, and the infinite diſtance 'twixt their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and themſelves.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>HAving thus exhibited my deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed method, I addreſs my ſelf to the firſt particular, to ſhew what it is to pray: And becauſe many may conjecture, that my labour may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd in this, ſince common practice will juſtly ſuperſede this ſcruple, I ſhall be very brief in the reſolution. Prayer then is no more than the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up our deſires unto God; In which the Soul has the honour, and advantage too, of breathing forth its wiſhes to our Maker, lodging them in the boſom, and heart of our. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor, and, through him, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning relief to ſupply all its neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wants. Now although this, when compleat, is joyned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and thankſgiving, yet, I ſhall not exceed the bounds of prayer, thoſe being duties diſtinct from this, and each requires a different explication. Various men conceive divers defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36404:9"/>of prayer, but yet they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingiſhed by words and phraſes more than ſence. One tells us 'tis a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or a converſe, with God; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, an aſcending of the Soul to him; and men exemplifie this duty by a multitude of Metaphors, that rather obſcure than explain the thing: Nay, ſome ſet up <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, in this caſe, for Angels to make their deſcent from Heaven, that they may obtain, again, a ſenſible and direct paſſage upwards, mount into the Regions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, carrying mens Petitions under their wings, and then convey the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God down to them. This may indeed be allowed for Rhetorick; but it neither explains or argues the thing. We may better gueſs at our Prayer unto God, by reflecting on our petitions to men, in which we always ſignifie our deſires which we earneſtly wiſh for, and humbly beg the grant of. And this I think to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notion we have of Prayer, which no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>man, that at all conſiders, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to give his aſſent to.</p>
               <p>Now this is made, when directed unto God, either in the inflamed, and ardent, deſires of our minds
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36404:9"/>when, devoutly fixing our intentions upon him, we ſecretly wiſh what we do not expreſs with our tongues: And we may eaſily ſuppoſe this method available, when the actions of our Souls are performed to him who as well underſtands the affections of our minds as the language of our mouths, and diſcerns our hearts, as well as hears our words. But our Prayers to God are alſo expreſs'd by thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſpeech, which he has framed as well for his ſervice as our own: When we put the wiſhes and deſires of our ſouls into ſuitable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive language, rehearſing this with the due and humble intention of our minds, and affection correſpondent to our petitions.</p>
               <p>And this is of two ſorts, either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, or publick. (1.) Private, and this either of Husband and Wife, who being in a ſence but one fleſh, have ſome neceſſities betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but, yet, being diſtinct from others, require different and more ſecret petitions. (2.) There is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate praying moſt properly ſo, which every man does (or ought to) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſingly by himſelf; when firſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36404:10"/>examining his ſtate and condition, he devoutly begs what he wants, either in relation to himſelf alone, or as a member of ſome particular ſociety, or elſe as he is within a larger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, the whole race of mankind. And of this ſort of Prayer, it is that our Saviour ſpeaks in that never to be parallel'd Sermon on the Mount: <hi>But thou, when thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet, and ſhut the door, and pray unto thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father, which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee openly.</hi> (Matth. 6.6.) A ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>caveat</hi> to the Phariſee and the Hypocrite, and a diſtinction betwixt theſe and the diſciples of our Lord. But (2.) there is publick Prayer, as well as private; And that either in, and with, our families, which are, indeed, ſmaller congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the Maſter exerciſes the office of the Prieſt, and, in his abſence, has thus much of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to intercede on earth in the behalf of his family, and to become the mouth and Orator for the reſt, that altogether by a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of affections, and unity in words, may petition thoſe things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36404:10"/>for them in common with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of humane nature, and in thoſe relations they bear to the family, and to each other. But (2.) Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is more publick, is ſuch as is made in the Church, or other places of Chriſtian Aſſemblies, conſigned to theſe publick offices, and by a ſolemn dedication ſet apart to Sacred and Divine uſes; And this I ſhall have a more ſpecial regard to, in what I ſhall recommend to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this diſcourſe; though men may alſo apply the particulars to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, as frequently as they ſhall find them rationally ſuited, and in this I would not ſeem to lay any yoke on the necks of diſciples, which they, in reaſon, may refuſe to bear.</p>
               <p>Now publick Prayers, in more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn conventions, and among grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter numbers aſſembled together, have ſo apparently been offered from the beginning of the Church, both under the Old and New-Teſtament, that the pretenſion to a proof, could not but be deemed vain and fooliſh; this being the reſult of reaſon, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together for common worſhip
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36404:11"/>being a duty imprinted on the ſouls of men, to the performance of which the light of nature has been their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. And if it required any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all from reaſon, we might preſently underſtand that by this Gods honour is exalted, when we jointly give a publick teſtimony of our piety and religion, that by this we propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate theſe things in the world, and by our examples provoke and ſtir up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to joyn in the ſame duty with our ſelves. That common requeſts, (ſuch as in publick we are ſuppoſed to make, to which every individual may ſay Amen) require a joynt and common conſent; and when our Prayers are thus connected, with the unity of our minds and ſpirits, they gain great degrees of power; like a twiſted Cord, they become more ſtrong and prevalent with God; they offer a Sacred violence to Heaven, and, (becauſe God is pleaſed with ſuch a Sacrifice) draw down favours from the Father of mercies.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſuch Prayers are apt to be offered up with greater reverence and devotion, when ſervice is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a Sacred place, in which God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36404:11"/>is more eſpecially preſent (at leaſt by his diſperſed train of Angels) where the objects of ſenſe caſt a ſecret awe upon our minds, and the mode and circumſtances of ſuch publick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, attended with proper Ceremonies and Solemnity, are apt to move us to humility and adoration, to excite within us the affections of our minds, to fix our intentions that they may be united to their object, make our paſſions ſuch as are Divine, and recal thoſe ſwimming and toſſing thoughts, which at any time are apt to wander. And finally, when our moſt ſolemn Prayers ſhall be offer'd by an ordained, or conſecrated, perſon Sacred, or (which is all one) ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the world to this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dedicated unto God by reſignation and ſolemnity, by his own devotion, and our Saviours inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he may become a ſecondary interceſſor betwixt the people and their Creator, he weeping betwixt the Porch and the Altar, and crying out to Heaven for pardon and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in that Sacred language, <hi>Spare us, Good Lord, Spare thy People.</hi> It cannot be but ſuch a ſervice muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36404:12"/>ſound as pleaſantly in the ears of God, as it is acceptable and rapturous to good men. And when we are thus gather'd together exerciſing the moſt exalted ſtrains of our minds, when they are ſcrewed beyond ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, Chriſt himſelf is in the midſt of us; he joyns in our Interceſſions and Prayers, the holy Angels ſpread their wings over us to adorn the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and God himſelf beholds us from above, looks through the Clouds with ſmiles upon us, ſmells a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the incenſe of our Prayers, and that he may look farther, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates all intercepting clouds. And this ſhall ſuffice to ſhew what Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</p>

               <p>LEt us now, in the ſecond place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider what may be the import of ſome phraſes and precepts in Sacred Writ which ſeem to ſet forth this duty of prayer, as if it were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without interruption. The <hi>Euchites</hi> of old were apt to conclude ſuch precepts and phraſes as <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, Continuing inſtant in Prayer,</hi> and the like, to be obligatory in the full latitude of their expreſſions: as if men were to do nothing elſe but pray: yet other duties that are required of us both as Chriſtians, and men too, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly refute ſuch unreaſonable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. Beſides, the allotments of all moral or pious actions ought to be proportionate to their ends, as the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a doſe of Phyſick is increaſed or diminiſhed according to the diſtemper of the Patient, varied ſo to tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſeaſons, as may beſt expel the venom of the diſeaſe, reſiſt its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and recover health to him that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36404:13"/>wants it. Now a great deſign and end of prayer, being to raiſe fervor and devotion in our ſouls, it ought no longer to continue, than we are able to keep up the intention of our thoughts, the elevation of our minds and the due order and ſallies of our affections. Hence is it, that we are informed by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that the Chriſtians in <hi>Egypt</hi> had frequent prayers, being brief eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and ſhort Collects, that a tedious continuation might not weary their affections, but their minds might be intended ſuitable to the ſeriouſneſs and gravity of the duty, and they might not prove either flat or ſtupid; leſt the prayer it ſelf ſhould, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, be nothing elſe but an effuſion of words without attention or manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of affection. From whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, our own Church has ordered her Publick Service, ſo as to conſiſt of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and diſtinct parts ſuitable to the variety and diverſity of our affections, that all may be ſucceſſively imployed, and none, at once, too long burdened: and therefore, our prayers are uſually brief, giving intervalls and reſpite both to Prieſt and people, that their ſouls and affections may recover ſtrength,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36404:13"/>and retrieve their vigour by theſe ſmaller interruptions, and not ſuffer too great a weakneſs to ſteal inſenſibly upon them, by being alwayes bent to their utmoſt power. Therefore the precepts and phraſes in holy Scripture that ſeem to import continuance in prayer, cannot be deſigned in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt latitude, which the ſound of words may uſually imply, but they muſt admit of limitation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
               <p>So that, to be ſhort in this; <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in prayer, and pray without ceaſing,</hi> and the like (1.) When we have ſuch prepared and ardent love to our Maker, our ſelves, and the fellow creatures of our own ſpecies, that the exciting cauſes of prayer and devotion are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent, when the opportunities of this duty offer themſelves. (2.) When we keep our ſelves in a perpetual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and aptitude for devotion when ever we have time and occaſion, and the reaſons for prayer return upon us. For as we ought alwayes to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for death, becauſe we know not how ſuddenly it may aſſault us; ſo we muſt endeavour to preſerve ſuch a ſetled temper in our own minds, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36404:14"/>our intentions and affections may be ready to exert themſelves in prayer upon any emergent or periodical oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. (3.) When we perform the ſolemn duties of our devotion with the higheſt ſtrains and fervours of our ſouls, continuing inſtant in prayer; when a longer protraction, or a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denyal of an anſwer to our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons does not diſcourage us to a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the omiſſion of our duty; but our diligence is renewed, our ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doubled, and we add force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to our prayers. This we are taught by that excellent Parable of the unjuſt Judge and importunate Widow, to the end (ſayes the Text) <hi>that men ought alwayes to pray, and not to faint,</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.1.) Laſtly, We may be then ſaid to <hi>pray without ceaſing, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue inſtant in prayer, to pray alwayes,</hi> and the like, when we make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of our prayers frequent, and our ſupplications to God are willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as often as times and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are afforded us. At leaſt it cannot come ſhort of this, to make prayer our every dayes work. So that <hi>nullâ die intermittantur certa tempora orandi;</hi> we muſt not omit our ſtated times and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36404:14"/>hours of devotion. And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no leſs rational than prayer it ſelf is pleaſant and advantageous, when we ſhall conſider, that we are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent beings, and daily need the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Heaven to ſupply our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and relieve our wants, and the kind Providence of Almighty God to ſupport and nouriſh us. The continual caſualties we are liable to, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent dangers we are involved in by our own inadvertency, the ſnares of the world, the nets which unfaithful or malicious men ſpread for us, and the violence or inſinuations of the Devil may call upon us for our daily prayers to him, who has promiſed to hear, and to deliver us. The daily preſenting our prayers to God, is recommended to us by the daily Sacrifice and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Law (<hi>Numb.</hi> 28. at the beginning.) Theſe were Types of the Chriſtian Service, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Morning and Evening, becomes our ſolemn and reaſonable devotion. Evening, Morning, and at Noon too, <hi>will I pray and cry aloud,</hi> ſayes <hi>David,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17.) And <hi>Daniel</hi> thought prayer ſo indiſpenſable a duty, that rather than omit it, he would endure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36404:15"/>the utmoſt ſeverity, even to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lions Den, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.) This is injoined in that prayer of our Lord which is to be both our form and our pattern, where we are taught to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our daily bread, day by day: Nor does he only, by this, prohibit too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate a care for the things of this life, but injoins us to teſtifie our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dependence upon our Maker, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding frequent and daily petitions. And it is but reaſonable, that we being delivered out of the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhould now ſerve God without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the dayes of our lives, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.75.) of which comprehenſive duties, our prayers and devotions are neceſſary parts. And thus much in relation to the ſecond particular mentioned in the Scheme of this diſcourſe, to conſider what may be the import of ſome phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and precepts in the Scriptures which ſeem to ſet forth this duty of prayer, as if it were to be continued without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion.</p>

               <p>I Now proceed to the Third Head of this diſcourſe of prayer, to make ſome enquiry concerning the object of it, and determine to whom we ought to addreſs our ſelves in our religious devotions of this kind. And this muſt, without all peradventure, be only to the Supream God, the Creator and Governour of all beings inferiour to himſelf. We honour (as we ought) the Graces and Vertues of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and the memory of the juſt is ſacred to us; we admire alſo the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Angels, and praiſe God for the various and uſeful workmanſhip of his hands. Nay, we treat all things in our thoughts and diſcourſes with that eſteem which is ſuitable to their beings, or that order which they poſſeſs in the Univerſe; and we advance our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations when we think of Angels, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the purity, and limited perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their beings, and their honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable employment of being the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36404:16"/>of the Lord of Hoſts, who has Legions of them at his diſpoſal. But there being, from him, neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nor argument for invocation of them, nor any reaſon to expect their aid otherwiſe than they are ordered by the King of Heaven, we therefore make no addreſſes to them by ſolemn prayers, and ſeparate devotions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are afraid to pay ſuch ſervices to a Creature, which muſt neceſſarily detract from the honour due to our Creator only. 'Tis true, indeed, we pay our ceremonies and demonſtrations of reſpect to men, on earth, ſuitable to their natural or acquired dignity: And common Juſtice commands our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal value and eſteem in ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their excellency and vertues: But we do not preſently fall down and worſhip every one that is richly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor petition thoſe things that are not in his power to beſtow. Nay, to proceed as far as we can without Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or ſin, we ſhould not refuſe to pay ſuch civil teſtimonies of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as the Patriarchs of old gave either to glorified Saints, or innocent and ever bleſſed Angels, ſhould they, at any time, aſſume ſhapes, and mix
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36404:16"/>themſelves among duſt and aſhes to negotiate any affairs with us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the ſimilitude of a humane converſation: Provided that we have ſufficient time to examine the truth of the Apparition, that we may be aſſured we are not impoſed on either by the Devil in the likeneſs of an Angel of Light, nor the s;lights and tricks of cunning Prieſts, or any falſe appearance to our own imaginations, or either ſubtile, or roguiſh inventions of other men; but might have good aſſurance that we are not deluded. Yet it will not, at all, from hence follow, that acts of Religion, appropriated to God, may be performed to thoſe to whom we acknowledge a civil reſpect to be juſt and due, this being only an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, expreſſed by outward ſigns and geſtures, ſuitable to their beings and degrees of perfection. And however men of contrary perſwaſions, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi>) who pretend to proportion their practice ſuitable to the conceptions of their minds, may ſave themſelves in this particular from the imputation of Idolatry, by ſtating curiouſly, the termination of their worſhip; yet they cannot free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36404:17"/>in this particular, from error and preſumption, from a voluntary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and will-worſhip, when they pay ſuch acts of Religion to creatures in glory, as approach ſo near to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Deity, that betwixt it and Idolatry, there hangs no more than a ſmall cobweb, a very nice and thin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. But we dare not conſtitute Mediators of our own, when God has appointed one for us; One even as God is ſo, and conſequently muſt exclude others. <hi>There is one God</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>and one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> (1 Tim. 2.5.) Nor will any diſtinction here ſerve, becauſe our Mediator intercedes in vertue of his Sacrifice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if there are more Mediators for us in Heaven, more muſt have ſhed their blood on earth. We deſire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the prayers of men living among our ſelves; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech'd the Brethren to pray for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but we do not invocate them by acts of Religion, when we beg this charitable office from them: Not do we intrench upon the great Interceſſor in the higheſt Heaven, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire theſe interceſſions upon the earth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36404:17"/>but only that the incenſe of other mens prayers, aſcending through the Skies to the ſupream Palace of the Moſt High, may be preſented unto God by the hands of our High Prieſt reſident there, not only as a token of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and victories whilſt he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, or reaſſuming the right belonging to his God head, but on purpoſe, alſo, to make interceſſion for us.</p>
               <p>If the Saints above could receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of our deſires, and we knew how to ſignifie our wants to them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our grievances to their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as we do to thoſe who converſe with us here: It is then probable, that many men would think it reaſonable to make that their deſire to them (though not by a religious act of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) which now they conjecture to be vain and fruitleſs: Becauſe their own neceſſities (themſelves being not yet compleatly glorified) might incline them to pray for men whom they left in this lower world, in relation to thoſe things eſpecially, that may tend to the fulfilling the number of Gods elect, and the haſtning that Kingdom which ſhall be compleated hereafter, that all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36404:18"/>partaking in a glorious tranſlation, or reſurrection, they themſelves may have the compleatment of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they now deſire, but ſhall not fully poſſeſs, till the re-union of their bodies to their ſouls, which death yet keeps in a ſtate of ſeparation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this ſeems reaſonable to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the charity of ſouls now in Heaven cannot but be advanced and extended, far beyond the poſſibilities of this world: and therefore as it is very probable (unleſs we ſuppoſe their underſtandings and memories to dye with them) that they may be now ſo mindful of the neceſſities of men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that are left behind them in a miſerable world, as to exert ſome acts in common, that may be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to prayer for us: So could men, who are yet reſident on the earth, know any method of ſignifying their particular deſires to them, they might perhaps inſert them in their wiſhes, and make ſuch petitions their own. For if the rich Glutton in Hell was ſo ſenſible of his Brethrens danger, as to beg <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> to them, to aſſure them of the truth of a future torment, and to warn them to flee from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36404:18"/>the wrath to come; much more may we ſuppoſe the Saints in Heaven to carry away with them ſuch notices and remembrance of the hazards and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of mankind in this world, that their enlarged charity may cauſe them, in general, to petition for their relief. But it does not, at all, from hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Saints above can be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of all the particular accidents in this world which now happen ſince their departure. Nor does <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s making a Looking glaſs of his Maker at all help the contrary aſſertion, the viewing all things in God, <hi>tanquam in ſpeculo,</hi> being as unintelligible by the reaſons of men, as it is inviſible to thoſe who have no eyes to ſee it. 'Tis true, indeed, God may reveal to them the neceſſities of the world, and ſomethings which happen here, and <hi>there is joy in Heaven for the converſion of a ſinner,</hi> (Luke 15.10.) But that he does theſe things to Saints departed, we have no evidence; but the contrary is aſſerted in Sacred Writ. <hi>For Abraham is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of us, and Iſrael acknowledges us not,</hi> (Iſa. 63.16.) And therefore <hi>neſciunt mortui, etiam ſancti, quid agunt vivi, etiam eorum filii,</hi> (ſayes S. <hi>Auſtin in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36404:19"/>curâ pro mortuis</hi>): The Saints that are dead know not what the living do; nay, their very Children. In vain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would it be (though it were not mixed with any impiety, nor done in the way of prayer, and religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation) to deſire any help from thoſe who are not acquainted with our wants, nor any where appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey bleſſings to us: Nay, if we were aſſured that they knew all our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar needs, as they have been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the infirmities of mankind, it could not be an argument to incline us to implore their aid and aſſiſtance, eſpecially with ſuch ſolemnity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion as is uſed in prayer: Becauſe God from whom we receive directions for the ſubſtantials, and eſſential me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of our devotion, has no where commanded ſuch circular prayers, that by the mediation of theſe, we ſhould at any time addreſs our ſelves to him. We are directed only by our Bleſſed Saviour to ask in his name; and to this we have the promiſe of an anſwer. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>he will give it you,</hi> (John 16.23.) And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> plainly exhorts, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36404:19"/>ſince we have ſo great an High Prieſt, who is paſſed into the Heavens, <hi>Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> (Heb. 4.6.) Here is no need of ſimilitudes from Courts below, to teach us methods of addreſs to him by whom Princes reign; Or if there were, what man that may him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſent his petition to an earthly King, and diſcourſe his affair freely with him, would uſe the mediation of a Maſter of Requeſts, eſpecially if the King himſelf had committed the care of this buſineſs to his Son? We need not argue our ſelves to reverence and humility in our addreſſes to God, when we conſider the diſtance and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt him and our ſelves, <hi>that he is our Creator, and we the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his hands,</hi> and therefore he has a right of being petitioned in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod himſelf has appointed; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he has been ſo favourable to us, who are ſinful duſt and aſhes, that, without his protection, ſhould be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the wind, and blown away with every ſtorm. And we muſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, if we are not too obſtinate, be excited to exerciſe due affection with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36404:20"/>devout intention, and an awful, though brisk, fervency in our minds, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the dangers we are liable to, when we are not guarded by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, the wants and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of our own frail and weak beings, the continual dependence we have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Maker, who is the <hi>great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of men,</hi> and the love and favour which he demonſtrates to thoſe who reverently adore him, and call upon his name. I ſhall therefore draw the concluſion of this particular, by giving ſome reaſons of the former aſſertion, That God alone is to be the object of our prayers, when we pretend to make religious addreſſes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>THe reaſons why God alone is to be the object of our prayers, are, (1.) Becauſe that ſupream vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which we demonſtrate by our ſolemn and moſt intenſe devotion in prayer, can be due to none, but to him who has all poſſible perfection, which none except the Supream God is endowed with. For if there were any perfection or excellency ſeated in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther independent of himſelf, God would then be finite in his excellencies, ſomething being ſuppoſed of perfection to be inherent in another, which is not in himſelf. But all creatures are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and limited, and could not be creatures, if they were not ſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever rayes of glory or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhine upon and adorn other beings to make them beautiful in their own kind, are emitted from that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sun which produces all things, and rules them by his power. Hence came that ſolemn acknowledgement
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36404:21"/>of pious <hi>David</hi> before all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; <hi>Thine, O Lord, is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the majeſty; for all that is in the heaven and the earth is thine; Thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as head above all: Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all; and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all;</hi> (1 Chron. chap. 29. v. 11, 12.). This alſo is moſt devoutly acknowledged in that great and ſolemn Faſt of the Jews, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou haſt made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their hoſt, the earth and all things therein, the ſeas and all that is therein, and thou preſerveſt them all; and the hoſt of heaven worſhippeth thee. And therefore who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord!</hi> (ſay the ſeven Angels) <hi>and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy name? For thou only art holy, becauſe all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgements are made manifeſt,</hi> (Rev. 15.4.) The creation of all things gives God the ſoveraignty over all, and from his dominion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his providence, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is an argument of our prayer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36404:21"/>and invocation, as an honour due to him from mankind, by reaſon of his own ſelf-exiſtent ſufficiency, and our dependence upon his eternal Being. Becauſe <hi>amongſt the Gods there was none like him, nor are any works like unto his;</hi> Therefore (ſayes <hi>David</hi>) <hi>all Nations, whom thou haſt made, ſhall come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before thee, O Lord, and ſhall glorifie thy name,</hi> (Pſal. 86.8, 9.) So that the foundation of mens worſhip being excellency and greatneſs, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing originally and independently in God, and in him alone; it follows, that all honour and glory are due to him, and none to others but for his ſake, and by his command; and particularly, that our divine acknowledgements, ſuch as are pretended in our prayers, he alone is capable of, and conſequently, muſt be the object of our devotions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I argue the truth of this, from the firſt notions men have of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, this having its prime relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; by this we enter into covenant with him, and oblige our ſelves to be ſubject to him according to duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon mankind by the Laws of their creation: For whether the name be derived <hi>à relegendo</hi> or <hi>religando,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36404:22"/>to the opinion of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> or S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it muſt ſtill be referr'd to God. Or if we had rather accept of <hi>Tully</hi>'s definition, that it is <hi>virtus quae ſuperiori cuidam naturae cultum ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niamque affert:</hi> a vertue that brings worſhip and ceremony to a certain ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour nature; this ſuperiour nature determined by <hi>cuidam,</hi> is but one, even the ſupream and moſt excellent being. Now prayer being an eminent act of religion, it follows, that it is due to God only. I know religion, and prayer too, are terms of an equivocal ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, and therefore capable of having many diſtinctions framed concerning them, to evade arguments, rather than anſwer them, when they endeavour to confine Gods worſhip to himſelf: when I treat, therefore, of religion here though, in a larger ſenſe, it includes other things, I intend, only, thoſe proper acts of duty and worſhip due to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being, flowing from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon of mankind, which our own obligations prompt us to; or impoſed on us by God himſelf, which he has declared in Sacred Writ in general, or particular, injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and by the inferences that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36404:22"/>may moſt directly and juſtly draw from it: And when I ſpeak of prayer, I ſuppoſe it to be a branch of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a ſolemn part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Now whatever elſe, beſides God himſelf, ſhares in this, detracts from the honour due to him, and joyns the Altar of God with Idols. For whatſoever elſe we admit to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in ſuch religious worſhip, ſo as to become an object of our prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a copartner with God himſelf; and the Univerſe conſiſting of God and creatures, what ever elſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly invocate muſt be ſome of the work of the Almighties hands; and then we give his glory to another, and his praiſe to them that are not gods; conſequently we diſpoſe the Creators honour to his own creatures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Architect to exalt his building; An affront that he will never ſuffer, who is a Jealous God, though it be given to the moſt worthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; becauſe he has declared againſt, and forbidden it; but never ſignified the lawfulneſs of it, either by his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick command or permiſſion; unleſs, becauſe he has ſuffered Idols till the worſhippers ſins were ripe for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36404:23"/>men will from thence conclude that he approved it. And dare bold men make Idols to themſelves which God ſo conſtantly forbids and hates? Or take others into partnerſhip with him, when he has declared himſelf to be the great Jehovah, ſuch a Lord as beſides him there is none other?</p>
               <p>But further, that God is only to be worſhipped in religion, ſeems a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo firmly rivetted in the natures of men, that though many have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken their God, yet few would pray to that which they thought to be none at all; and therefore when they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſuch Images, which they could not chuſe but know were nothing but the carved work of mens hands, yet they therefore prayed to them becauſe they thought them to be inſpired with divinity, and that the Deity it ſelf was confined to ſome reſidence in them, and ſo they pretended to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their God within the Image, and not unto the Block or Stone it ſelf, but through the caſe they paſs'd to the divinity; ſuch little ſhifts do others alſo, who ſhould underſtand Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better, uſe to ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of their Idols, being
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36404:23"/>ſo well inſtructed by the Pagans who were more ancient than themſelves. But to give the honour of God to a creature muſt needs appear unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Religion, ſince no Subject can with Loyalty pay the homage due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the King, to any, though the moſt noble Peer, when it is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the King alone; and therefore God having reſerved divine worſhip, ſuch as ſolemn prayer of which I treat, only to himſelf, no man can lawfully give it to another, and think it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with true Religion: But of this more in my laſt argument for prayer to be made to God only.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God alone is to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our prayers, becauſe none but he can anſwer the end and deſign of our petitions. Who amongſt all the glories of the Creation, is ſo capable of underſtanding, or beſtowing the things we petition for, or endowed with ſuch qualifications as may render him fit for rational creatures, in all their exigencies to become devout pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners unto? Can any give us the pardon of our ſins by his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or diſpence with the breach of Gods Law but himſelf? When he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36404:24"/>this by the miniſtration of others, they are only his ſubſtituted Delegates, and he no more gives his glory to them than he will part with his praiſe to a graven Image. Who can beſtow grace or glory but he who has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite fulneſs of both, whoſe treaſure is inexhauſtible; whoſe ſpirit, from whence our graces are conveyed, is compared in Scripture, not only to the Wind which bloweth where it liſteth, but alſo to a fountain of living waters always ſpringing up unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? And who can beſtow the glory above but he whoſe preſence makes it ſo, whoſe right hand holds Stars, and has all Crowns at his own diſpoſal? Who can rid us of many troubles, eſpecialy thoſe that diſquiet our minds, but he that can rebuke tempeſts and ſtorms, diſpel the clouds that hang over them, and deliver the righteous out of all their afflictions? There are three things neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a perſon qualified for ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creatures to make their religious addreſſes to. (1.) That he be capable of hearing and underſtanding our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. (2.) That he is able to beſtow what we ſupplicate him for. And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36404:24"/>(3.) That he is willing to give what we beg, if it may be conſiſtent with his prudence and our welfare. And whom can we find thus qualified but the great God whom we adore and worſhip? Who is omniſcient and can underſtand our petitions and knows our wants; Omnipotent, and therefore can anſwer our deſires; and of infinite goodneſs, and ſo willing to relieve us in ſuch things as may conſiſt with his providence and our advantage. If theſe things are wanting in the object of our prayers, all our addreſſes will be rendred fruitleſs. If he cannot hear, or is not able to relieve, or is very hard and not willing to be kind to us; To what purpoſe then do we utter our wants, and earneſtly beg relief from him? If beggars knew ſuch men among our ſelves, they would ſpare their breath whilſt theſe paſſed by: ſo that I may now propoſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi>'s que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> with better reaſon than that in which the Papiſts urge it, <hi>Call now if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn?</hi> (Job 5.1.) An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves would be charged with folly, ſhould they attempt an anſwer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36404:25"/>to our religious petitions without a declar'd permiſſion, or command from their Maker; how much more thoſe who have dwelt in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation was in the duſt, who have been cruſhed before the moth, and all their excellency and glory which we admired here, went away, when they were deſtroyed from Morning to Evening? The dead (for ought I could ever yet underſtand) can no more hear us than <hi>Baal</hi> could his Prophets when they cryed to him from morning till noon; they can no more anſwer to our call than they can praiſe God with the inſtruments of ſpeech when their deferred carcaſſes lay rotting in a Grave. But God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has given teſtimonies of his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſeveral waies convers'd with men: He hears our prayers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands our thoughts afar off. He has three attributes that render him fit for our religious addreſſes. For (1.) he is omnipotent, and therefore there is nothing we can petition from him, but he is able to grant, and to beſtow it; For power being only an ability ſo to exerciſe cauſality as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence cauſes to produce their effects,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36404:25"/>he that is the Author of cauſes, being the origin of all things, muſt needs be the fountain of all power, and he that is ſo muſt be omnipotent, and therefore is able to fullfil our deſires. (2.) He is omniſcient too, and therefore certainly knows our wants: For know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſts in an exertion of power, as all actions proceed from an ability, and are the exerciſe of ſome power; he therefore that is omnipotent muſt needs be omniſcient alſo. For were there any thing that he could not know, there would be ſomething out of the compaſs of his power, and the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his omnipotence would be weakned and deſtroyed: nor does the not knowing or effecting impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or contradictions at all invalidate theſe glorious attributes; becauſe thoſe are ſo far from being things in act, that they are not capable of being ſuch in power, nor can any futurity give them being: And what is, and muſt remain nothing, can neither be the proper object of ſtrength, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. (3.) God has infinite goodneſs eſſential to his being; the creation of the world proceeded from it, and that he now ſupports it, is owing to his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36404:26"/>grace and favour; and his goodneſs, beſides particular examples, is viſible to us in his daily providence: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the two former attributes he could neither have made, nor could he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and govern the world; and to make him a Being with infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Almighty power without any goodneſs to allay the exerciſe of it, ſurppoſes him to be nothing elſe but an omnipotent Devil; for what Beings are that have ſufficient power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good nature to reſtrain it, they that are frequently oppreſs'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers know by too woful and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly experience.</p>
               <p>Theſe glorious Attributes therefore of power, knowledge, and goodneſs, being thus rationally fixed in the God whom we adore, he becomes a fit object of our prayers, and one in whom we may confide and truſt, ſince under the ſhadow of his wings there is ſafety; He has declared that he keeps mercy for thouſands, and the marks of it are viſible in our beings, living, and our allotments in this world; and eſpecially it appears in his wonderful redemption of mankind, when he gave his Son to be a Ranſome for us all, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36404:26"/>received him into Heaven that he might fulfill his promiſes made on Earth, and make continual interceſſions for us, in vertue of his bloody ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the Croſs. To diſtruſt the goodneſs of ſuch a God, would be both ungrateful and inhumane, to be the moſt ſurly and vileſt Penſioners in the world, to provoke the utmoſt of his wrath and fury; and we muſt unman our ſelves before we can thus ungod the Deity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that I may urge a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding argument; God alone is to be the object of our prayers, becauſe he has commanded us thus to worſhip him, and has prohibited the offering our religious devotions to any other: This is engravened upon the tables of the moral Law, which is of a ſtanding and perpetual eſtabliſhment; That we ſhall have no other Gods but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And that we ſhall not make to our ſelves any Idol to worſhip, nor the ſimilitude of any thing religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to fall down before it (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.) and he backs the prohibition with an argument drawn from the Jealouſy he has of being deprived of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and a ſolemn declaration that he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36404:27"/>will ſeverly puniſh the guilty. We find therefore that when <hi>Aaron,</hi> to appeaſe the multitude, made a molten Calf, which the people ſuppoſed to be a repreſentation of their Deliverer, and the God that brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> rearing an Altar upon which they made their burnt, and peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; though they ſeemed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate their worſhip in God, transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their oblations through this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to him that was ſuperiour to the offerings and the Idol, making God the ultimate object of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions by proclaiming this to be a feaſt unto Jehovah; yet we find that the fire kindled for this ſacrifice, made the wrath of God to burn; nor could <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s interceſſion expiate the crime; but he blotted their names out of the book of Life, there were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlain three thouſand of them, and God continued to plague the people, ſcattering their carcaſes about the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and in their progreſs viſited this ſin upon them. (<hi>Exod.</hi> 33.) Nay men are not only thus cautioned, by many precepts and examples in the Old Teſtament, that they approach not near the confines of Idolatry, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36404:27"/>give Gods glory to another, or his praiſe to graven, or molten Images; (too numerous for me to reckon up here, and granted by all who have any knowledge of thoſe Scriptures) But God has ſufficiently forbidden it under the New, where he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his worſhip more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to his being, and the ſervice of Chriſtians to be agreeable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſpirit and in truth, neither with the corporal repreſentation of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> nor in their ſchiſm; nor yet according to the worſhip of the <hi>Jews</hi> by bloody ſacrifices, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der types and ſhadows prefiguring any Meſſias to come; nor yet as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by any of their inferiour Daemons. When Satan tempted our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with the ſame bait which others make a tender of to thoſe whom they endeavour to proſelyte, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me;</hi> He preſently repell'd him with diſdain and ſcorn: <hi>Get thee behind me Satan; For it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> (Matth. 4.10.) If God would have been worſhipped by the mediation of any but the great
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36404:28"/>Mediator of the New Covenant, who is the Image of the inviſible God, he would not have left mankind in the dark, but there would have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light in this as well as other things that ſeem not ſo conſiderable, to have guided them to the performance of that which he expected in his ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from them. But no directions to this appear, nor can the Scriptures, at all, patronize it, unleſs corrupted by falſe gloſſes, and forced interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yet the contrary is as clear as the Sun, and all eyes that are not blind may behold it. Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thoſe glorious creatures which are apt to draw the utmoſt of our civil reſpects to them, refuſe to ſhare in the honour of their Maker, and prohibit the Testimonies of Divine worſhip. The Angel which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to converſe with Saint <hi>John,</hi> when this beloved Diſciple proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to worſhip him, ſuddenly replyed, ſee thou do it not; and urges two arguments to inforce his prohibition, enough to deter all mankind from paying acts of Religion to a creature: (1.) ſayes he, I am thy fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and of thy brethren, the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36404:28"/>off-spring of the univerſal Parent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch honour is not due to me. (2.) God being the object of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch homage is juſtly appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to himſelf, and therefore, ſayes the Angel, worſhip God. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10.) Nay worſhipping God by the mediation of Angels beguiles Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the reward and Crown which they ſtrive for: <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. And much more muſt they miſs their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, if they make their religious addreſſes to the Angels themſelves, begging of them what is part of Gods prerogative to grant. Now as the invocation of theſe detracts ſo much from the glory of their Maker; ſo, much more, do we derogate from his honour if we make religious petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto Saints: For theſe are of an inferior claſſis, their natures being not capable of thoſe embelliſhments that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn Angels. Therefore when <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> fell down and worſhipped Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſnatched him up, and bad him ſtand upon his feet, and forbear ſuch ſignals of reverence to him, which were uſually paid in acts of devotion; <hi>For,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I my ſelf alſo am a man.</hi> (Acts 10.26.) Thus alſo did <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36404:29"/>
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi> refuſe the worſhip of the <hi>Lycaonians,</hi> rending their cloaths at their publick blaſphemy and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Idolatry; and ſtopp'd their Sacrifice with an argument that, methinks, ſhould ſtartle others; <hi>We alſo are men of like paſſions with you.</hi> (Acts 14.15.) This is the laſt argument therefore, why God alone is to be the object of our prayers, becauſe we are commanded to worſhip him in ſacred Writ, and forbidden to offer our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to another. And this may ſuffice for anſwer to my third En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, by ſhewing us to whom we ought to make our religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>I Proceed now to enquire into the mode of our addreſs to the great God, whom, for his infinite excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we adore and worſhip, upon ſuppoſition that he only is to be the object of our religious devotions, in which ſolemn prayer bears a great ſhare: In this ſome of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among us, raiſed by perſons who are gone out from us, will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (though not as much as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) regarded. And therefore I ſhall enquire into the manner in which we ought to pray; And (1.) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the intentions of our minds. (2.) In relation to the geſture of our bodies. (3.) To ſhew ſomething which may regard our words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The rnanner of our addreſſes with reference to the intention of our minds ought to be ſuch as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude great activity in our rational faculties, and exert our affections in ſome proportion to the value of our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36404:30"/>petitions, and the moſt glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whom we invoke. Particularly ſo, that the more conſiderable and worthy our prayers are, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and earnest muſt our deſires be. The external repreſentations of any mans devotion without the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fervency of his mind are acts of hypocriſie, not religion: 'Tis like the common diſſimulations amongſt our ſelves, when we fawn upon a man till we obtain an opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him. <hi>My Son</hi> (ſayes Wiſdom) <hi>give me thine heart.</hi> (Prov. 23.26.) And the firſt and great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law, according to our Saviours interpretation, is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy might, and with all thy ſoul.</hi> (Matth. 22.37.) Hence are thoſe declared bleſſed, by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that ſeek God with their whole heart.</hi> (Pſal. 119.2.) And by this rule was King <hi>David</hi> himſelf wont to manage his addreſſes. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee,</hi> (ſayes he to God <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 10.) <hi>And I intreated thy favour with my whole heart.</hi> (verſ. 58.) And he urges it as an argument why God ſhould hear him, <hi>becauſe he cryed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36404:30"/>with his whole heart,</hi> (verſ. 145.). His mind was intent on, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his petitions, and his ſeriouſneſs in this ſnatch'd away his Soul wholly to it ſelf, and the God to whom he made his addreſſes: ſo muſt we, in our prayers to the ſupream Being, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attend to what we deſire, and being firſt ſatisfied concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſions of our prayers, our moſt earneſt wiſhes muſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the words in which we preſent our petitions unto God. Now this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be done unleſs (1.) we underſtand the phraſes and words in which we utter the petitions of our minds: For how can we intend our ſouls, and raiſe our affections ſuitable to the weight and urgency of our prayers, when we do not underſtand what is offered by our ſelves, or any other in our behalf? There muſt, in prayer, be an elevation of our minds accompanying our petitions, and our ſouls muſt in a manner paſs into our devotions, that they may be totally imployed in this duty, for the time we are about it, without any diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reflections; But this can never be when we have not previous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36404:31"/>of the matter of our prayers, and a ſufficient perception of the ſence of our petitions, nay and, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, the very expreſſions then uſed. For the ſoul being otherwiſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the invention of method and ſenſe, and ſtraining alſo for words to expreſs it, or in paſſing judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inventions of another who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to utter the wants of a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in a new dreſs, and every time with variation of phraſes; All know that the ſoul of man can exert but one act at the ſame inſtant, nor conſider any more than one thing at once; how then can it judge and apprehend at the ſame time, raiſe its affections propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the petition, and keep it ſelf fixed upon God in any tolerable meaſure? It cannot therefore, with equal paces, accompany a prayer which it does not underſtand before it comes to make uſe of it. And, truly, were this well and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it would render prayers uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inſufficient that are either made in an unknown tongue, or in Engliſh phraſes that are unpremedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unintelligible, or unknown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand to thoſe who are to joyn in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36404:31"/>the oblation, ſo as to bind up their aſſent to the petitions, and to ſatisfie themſelves that they pray with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. As to any objection that may be made from mens joyning in prayers which they never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in the caſe when a ſtranger comes to preach; it may eaſily be anſwered that no man can aſſent to the whole with understanding, unleſs he be a perſon of extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, or he that prayes makes more than common pauſes at the end of every period of a petition, that all may have time to apprehend, and judge, and put up an earneſt wiſh with it. Otherwiſe, ſome periods ſubſequent muſt needs paſs before the antecedent has been conſidered, unleſs it may be allowed to have ſuch an implicit faith in a man, that whatever he ſayes at ſuch a time is Goſpel; and whither this will carry us may be eaſily known, ſince it is the direct road to <hi>Rome:</hi> For if we may implicitly believe particular men without examination, in caſes that are in our own power; much more, will they ſay, may we believe the Church. But Prayer indeed conſiſts not in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble effuſion of words and language,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36404:32"/>but this muſt be attended with a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervour, which cannot be without a dueintention of mind, and this requires a previous acquaintance with what is uttered, that the underſtanding may command and regulate the affections. When the underſtanding is thus juſtly informed beforehand, we may be more zealous and earneſt in raiſing our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to a decent height, and ſo ſix our intentions upon the object of our prayers, and the weightineſs of the things we petition for, that our ſouls will ſuffer ſome kind of tranſport, and be ſwallowed up wholly in them. Have you not ſeen a perſon who delights in muſick, ſo raviſhed with the ſtrokes made upon his Viol, and tranſported with thoſe pleaſant Aires, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of his mind, and all his faculties have been ſo fully imployed that he has diſregarded all things elſe, as if his ſoul had ſuffered a tranſmigration, and had wholly paſs'd into the inſtrument he played on? Thus ſhould it be (as far as humane frailty will permit) with men devoutly earneſt in prayer; we ſhould come to it with ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and ſeriouſneſs of mind, that knowing before what we deſign to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36404:32"/>petition Heaven for, we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent like men begging for their lives, and every prayer were the laſt we ſhould make; that ſo, God, ſeeing our fervour and devotion, may be inclined to hear, and to have mercy. For when, at any time, our minds wander in our prayers, and do not accompany the words uttered; ſo much of the prayers are loſt to us as are paſſed over whilſt we permitted the diverſion; and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy by which we may intereſt our ſelves in what is gone, is, in my opinion, to recollect the petitions as well as we can, (which we may do where the uſual forms of the Church are uſed) and utter an hearty Amen to them. (2.) We muſt, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our minds in our ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, fix our ſouls on the object of our prayers, and as much as we can throughout the whole, carry along, whilſt we utter our wants, ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that glorious Being to whom we make our religious addreſſes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the firſt entrance upon them, that we may not pray to a wrong object, or to none at all. Now in this I fear many may fail, and in their prayers make an Idol in their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36404:33"/>fancies when yet they abhor one that is ſenſible, or material, repreſented to their bodily eyes: For we are apt to frame to our ſelves (eſpecially men who are not uſed to abſtraction) a repreſentation of God by ſomething which has been expoſed to our ſenſes, or at leaſt by a confuſed joyning of many of theſe objects together: But this is worſhipping by a falſe ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which we juſtly accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others for. And yet the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſeems not to be ſo great, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſimilitude of our God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be repreſented to our external ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or in the Idea and Image of our minds, when we frame ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Picture there, and turn our eyes inward to behold it. For the fault ſeems not to be much alleviated when we refuſe to frame a carved Image to repreſent him to whom we pray, if in the mean time we create one in our own imagination, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelves before it, and pray with the direction of our intentions to it. Were we capable indeed of framing an Idea of him; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an exact ſimilitude of God: no doubt but it would become our duty,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36404:33"/>as well as our priviledge to make this repreſentation of him to our ſelves, and it might become an excellent mean to keep our ſouls and minds intent. But there are two reaſons (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) why this is impoſſible to be done: (1.) Becauſe God is a Spirit; ſomething that is void of all matter, not capable of parts, or ſuch quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative extenſion as bodies have, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we cannot frame any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and proportionate notion of him all together, as we can of thoſe things which we have ſeen; but we know his being only by his Attributes, which we cannot conſider all at once, as we can the figure and proportion of a man, together with the Being to which theſe Attributes belong. That God is, may eaſily be demonſtrated; but what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Being he is to which theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are fixed, will, I think, be difficult to be apprehended by men, to whom the bare eſſences of things, far inferior, are ſo latent and abſtruſe: So that they muſt be forced to acknowledge God to be incomprehenſible: For we find that when we retire within our ſelves, and ſhut up our ſouls never ſo much from any communication with exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36404:34"/>objects, though we can frame propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and diſcourſes concerning ſpirits; yet we can have no repreſentations of them, or figures of proportion, as we can make of other things which have been the objects of our ſenſes, though they are at preſent at a diſtance from us, or ſhut out from our view by the darkneſs of the night, or a cloſure of our eyes. And, to ſay truth, could a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be drawn by us under a ſimilitude, it muſt put off its nature, and become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, whilſt we draw an Image of it, &amp; it muſt be ſubject to our external ſenſes. Hence was it that our Saviour confuted the worſhip of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has evidenced) worſhipped God under the ſimilitude of a Dove, and plainly told the woman he convers'd with, that they worſhipped they knew not what, becauſe the object to whom they directed their intentions was confined to this reſemblance whilſt they were at their devotions. When all this while God was a ſpirit, and ſuch as pretended to his ſervice ought to addreſs themſelves to him under that notion, in ſpirit and in truth, and not by any corporal repreſentation. And indeed it ſeems to be very unreaſonable to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36404:34"/>draw lineaments and proportions of God by our own fancies and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations when he has no ſuch things in himſelf; nor (as Chriſt ſayes) has any man ſeen the Father. (2.) 'Tis impoſſible for us to frame a poſitive Idea or any adequate repreſentation of God in our minds, becauſe he is an infinite Being, and our ſouls are but of finite capacities. And what is finite cannot frame or receive an Idea that is infinite: For what is ſo can no more be limited or circumſcribed, than an infinite ſpace can be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or drawn into the number of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions; and this can never be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatever a thing is meaſured by, muſt either ſingly be commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to it or, elſe by the reduplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſhorter meaſure we muſt at laſt ſum up its parts and proportions into one intire dimenſion in breadth, depth, and length. But what infinite meaſure can we find out that ſhall ſtretch it ſelf parallel to what is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether infinite, ſince what is ſo has no ends? Or what number of meaſures can poſſibly reach it? If it could be run over, it had an end, and then how could it be called infinite? If it could
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36404:35"/>be ſuppoſed that one infinite could be the meaſure of another, and no penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet admitted; then one muſt be where the other is not, and then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could be accounted infinite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one bounds and limits the other: If a penetration through the whole ſhould be ſuppoſed and granted, both infinites would be but one; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the thoughts of a meaſure muſt periſh. So that for a finite Being to endeavour to comprehend an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite eſſence, or to frame an Idea, or an adequate repreſentation of him is more impoſſible than for a man to graſp the Globe of Earth in the hollow of his hand, to carry the greateſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon his ſhoulder, when he has torn it from the reſt of the earth; to drink up the Ocean at one draught, or any thing elſe that is more difficult; there being ſome proportion betwixt things that are finite, but between a finite and an infinite none at all. When we can contain the Sea and Rivers in an empty-eggſhel, ſhoot the fixed Stars down from heaven, take a leap from the Earth to the Moon, make the leaſt Veſſel to hold all the contents of the greateſt, or do any thing elſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36404:35"/>that is more impoſſible, then may we attempt (though we ſhall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it) to frame a notion and repreſentation of the Deity, that may be equal to his infinite being. But, in the mean time, let us beware of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Idol, whilſt we endeavour to avoid a ſubstantial one.</p>
               <p>Yet ſince the nature and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man is ſuch, that we are apt, in our invocations of God, to frame ſimilitudes and repreſentations of that Being to whom we make our religious addreſſes. It may not be amiſs if I here endeavour briefly to inform you what (as I conceive) ought to be the apprehenſions and ſentiments of mens minds, with reference to the great and ſupream God, to whom they pray; that the intentions of their ſouls may be rationally, and alſo piouſly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in this important and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty of their lives. To effect this, it muſt be remark'd that the God, whom we pretend to worſhip, contains within himſelf all manner of perfection; and conſequently he muſt include all thoſe things, which his own declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have manifeſted to the World; or the reaſon of men have, lawfully,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36404:36"/>and by good conſequence, concluded to be moſt excellent and glorious in themſelves. He muſt be endow'd, therefore, with all knowledge, power, goodneſs, impaſſibility, juſtice, truth, mercy, faithfulneſs, and the like, with ſelf exiſtency and eternity crowning and adding an ornament to the whole. To this God then under ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notions, adorned with ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Attributes, and all poſſible perfections imaginable; To this King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſe God, we are to give all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, adoring thoſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buts of which we are tranſcribing the Copy, as far as frail humane nature will permit; and by which, only, we can declare his eſſence. To this tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being we ought to pray without pretending to form an Idea, or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his living ſubſtance, which we cannot make any likeneſs of, nor frame a due Image of his being without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions attending, that are unworthy of him; and ſuch accidents as would be blemiſhes and imperfections, at once leading us into impiety and a ſnare. And to ſuch a Being, when we have once ſetled a notion of him before we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36404:36"/>enter upon our devotions to him, we may addreſs our lawful petitions, and direct all the intentions of our minds, without framing any ſimilitude; and worſhip him who is, and was, the Maker of all things, ſuſtains the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by his Almighty power, and influences the whole by his daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Who (as I believe) cannot be drawn otherwiſe by the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate judgment, the moſt towering phancy, or ſublimeſt and moſt retired contemplation, becauſe he is inviſible. To this univerſal Being, who is the cauſe and parent of all others, if we thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſuitable petitions, <hi>we ſhall worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth, and the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> (John 4. 23.) And thus I have done with the firſt part of the manner of our addreſs, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the intention of our minds.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the ſecond parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to make inquiry into that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which we ought to pray with reference to the geſture of our bodies. Now this, in general, ought to be ſuch as is moſt expreſſive of our humility, reverence, profound devotion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God; and therefore ſuch as is uſed to theſe ends and purpoſes in the Regions and Countries in which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36404:37"/>we live. For prayer teſtifying our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to others, and by our outward example (for they cannot know our inward thoughts) drawing them into the ſame acts of devotion with our ſelves, as well as, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of our Maker, to raiſe and ſignifie our own diſpoſitions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him; ſince, therefore, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men can no way be made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the intentions of our minds, but by thoſe repreſentations which they receive from the external acts and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of our bodies, we ought to uſe ſuch in prayer as may beſt ſignifie thoſe to them; which can be no other than thoſe by which we repreſent both our humility and affection to thoſe perſons with whom we converſe. 'Tis true, indeed, I cannot ſay that the ſacred Scriptures have commanded any one geſture in prayer, ſo ſtrictly as to exclude all others. For in theſe things, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, at any time, becomes a reaſonable diſpenſation. A man may be enſeebled in his limbs, lay ſtretch'd upon a bed of languiſhing, be moved to ejaculations, when he is imployed in his Trade, or occupation: He may be inclined to pray when he is walking in the field, or travelling on a journey,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36404:37"/>and may often be lifting his thoughts to God when he is ſitting at his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meals: In ſuch caſes, and others like them, he is not obliged to alter his poſture; but God will accept of his ſecret whiſpers, or more outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs'd language; nay, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breathings and wiſhes of his mind, with, or without, the words of his mouth. And further yet, ſometimes, even in publick Aſſemblies, a man (or woman) may be in a Croud, or his Knees ſo benum'd and his body wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the length of his devotions, that any one poſture may be ſo uneaſie, and painful too, as to blunt the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his affections, and hinder the moſt acceptable intention of his mind; And God forbid that the more noble part of our devotions ſhould be ſlackned or interrupted by the neceſſary attendance on the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſs of our own bodies; for this would render them not only the reſtraining priſons of our ſouls, but their Jaylors too: And certainly he to whom our prayers are directed, being gracious and merciful, will not injoyn any burden upon men, who are humble and devout, which neither they nor
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36404:38"/>their Forefathers were able to bear. I cannot, therefore, ſufficiently admire the piety and prudence of our own Church, whoſe Service is ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly contrived that the frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures of praiſes and thankſgivings, readings, and confeſſions of our faith, with our prayers and the confeſſions of our ſins; give frequent relief to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or wearied, bodies of men, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning ſuitable, though uniform, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, that by their variation become eaſie and delightſome, and advance the fervour, and affections of the mind. But that I may not deviate from this duty of Prayer: We find goodmen, in Sacred Writ, ſometimes worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by proſtration on the ground, ſometimes adoring by bowing their heads, and, without doubt, kiſſing their hands, as the act of adoring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies; ſometimes ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their feet, and ſometimes kneeling upon their knees: But in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament the latter is more frequent, though proſtration is a poſture more lowly than this. When Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> had the honour to become the firſt Martyr to the Faith of Jeſus, next to himſelf, and like his Maſter, ſignaliz'd his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36404:38"/>in praying for his enemies, the Text tells us, that <hi>he kneeled down and prayed; crying out, with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> (Act. 7.60.) When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the Biſhops at <hi>Miletus, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.</hi> (Acts 20.36.) When Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſealed the truth of Chriſtianity by that eminent miracle of raiſing <hi>Dorcas</hi> from the dead, we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>he kneeled down and prayed.</hi> (Act. 9.40.) And the bleſſed and holy Jeſus himſelf, who was more worthy than all mankind, becauſe he was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a juſt and proportionable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them, and redeemed thoſe who were priſoners to Death and Hell; yet that he might teſtifie the great humility and ſubmiſſion of his mind, did not only fall down upon his knees, but proſtrated himſelf with his face to the ground, when, with a reſerved ſubmiſſion to his Fathers will, he prayed, ſaying; <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi> (Matth. 26.39.) When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that they might not faint in the midſt of their tribulations, <hi>he bowed his knees
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36404:39"/>to the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (Eph. 3 14.) And when, in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he landed at <hi>Tyre,</hi> at his departure from thence, himſelf, with the diſciples, their wives, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

'Tis true indeed it was a cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially towards the period of their Oeconomy, to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read that the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> like ſome among our ſelves, loved to pray ſtanding in their Synagogues, as well as in the corners of the ſtreets. (<hi>Math.</hi> 6.5.) But becauſe theſe did it, that by the elevation of their bodies they might be ſeen of men, you may not, perhaps, think it fitting to take ſuch for an example. But, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is no leſs, but more certain that the primitive Chriſtians did, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, pray ſtanding on their feet, as well as kneeling upon their knees; For, beſides the poſture in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions on the Lords day, it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known that they did not kneel
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36404:39"/>in their publick worſhip from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> But then they gave theſe two reaſons in excuſe of their poſture (1.) That they might by ſome outward geſture, and ſignificant cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, expreſs their joy for the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Saviour. (2.) That it was in token alſo of their confident expectation of the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt. Both theſe things were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and proper whilſt Chriſtianity was contemned by the Rulers of the world, and ſuch great temptations were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the proſelytes, to this religion to apoſtatize. That I may draw, then, towards the concluſion of this particular; ſince the geſtures of the body have been differently uſed in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto God, ſuitable to the various wayes of ſignifying reſpect in divers Countries, and the conſtitutions of thoſe Churches to whoſe cuſtoms men ſubjected themſelves, and ſince all ſuch things are ſtill to be uſed in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to a greater, and more lofty, end, the raiſing and teſtifying the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and faith of mens minds, I ſhall leave you to practiſe Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> rules; That in private prayer, ye ſo frame the geſtures of your bodies
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36404:40"/>as may beſt conduce to the elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your minds, and the continuance of great devotion in your prayers: But in publick that ye conform to the commands and practice of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, which impoſes nothing ſinful as a condition of her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, within whoſe pale you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, that ye may not become factious, and ſchiſmatical, divide from ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials for a ceremony, nor rend the Church and make a ſeparation for what is really, in it ſelf, indifferent. Humility and reverence do certainly become ſuch as addreſs themſelves to God, and he that has lived here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that upon the view of our uſual approaches to our ſuperiours, and the cuſtom of the nation in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to one another, can find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geſture more aptly and decently expreſſing theſe things, than bowing the body, uncovering the head, and bending the knee, may (if our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors pleaſe who have authority to order indifferent matters) uſe it, and recommend it to others; Nay, obtain a Law to force it upon all. Yet this will be but little to their profit; ſince I know none that, upon ſuch ſlender
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36404:40"/>terms, will relinquiſh their own right to make way for others to enter their poſſeſſions; becauſe they will not make religion to conſiſt in the uſe or forbearance of things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in themſelves. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, till this time of tryal comes, we were, (in my judgment) bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fulfill what God once confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Oath; <hi>That unto him every knee ſhould bow, and every tongue ſhould ſwear by his name.</hi> (Iſai. 45.23.) Which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought good to expreſs the ſubjection of mankind to the ſupream Being by, in the New Teſtament. <hi>As I live (ſaith the Lord) every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God.</hi> (Rom. 14.11.) And, truly, when any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians pretend to expreſs their real and devout ſubjection to God, 'tis not ſo well to forſake the ceremony which God himſelf, the command of the Church, and the reaſon of men uſing the ceremonies of this Nation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is conjoyned with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, may render not only lawful, but expedient. But yet I muſt proceed farther; That, with the former cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſuppoſed, kneeling at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36404:41"/>will become a duty, where the formentioned impediments do not plead for a neceſſary, and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpenſation. 'Tis true, indeed, that bodily exerciſe profiteth little, (yet ſomething it does) if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the devotion of the mind, and does not tend to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoul, in the habits of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and true religion; But when this accompliſhes the ends to which it is moſt rationally deſigned, it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch a ſacrifice with which God is well pleaſed. <hi>I beſeech you therefore brethren,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts) <hi>by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living ſacrifice, holy, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, which is your reaſonable, divine ſervice.</hi> (Rom. 12. 1.) Nay we do not worſhip with the whole man, when we neglect Gods ſervice with a part. Moreover, it ſeems not to be a reaſonable ſervice, when the actions of the body do not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the affections of the mind, when both are joyn'd together in this world: We think it to be rational to expreſs the petitions conceived in our hearts by the language of our tongues: Why ſhould we not then
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36404:41"/>ſignifie our humility, that muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſuch prayers as God accepts, by thoſe geſtures that repreſent and expreſs it? 'Tis exceeding natural to mankind to make ſhew of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection, by external ſigns, and the kindeſt demonſtrations that the actions of their bodies are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent; and we put a force and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon our ſelves, when our hearts are full of fervour and devotion, and, yet, we will not manifeſt it by our actions and deportments. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he who has created the bodies of men as well as their ſouls, has an equal right to the ſervice of both; and he that made the whole man will not be ſatisfied with a partial ſacrifice: we muſt worſhip therefore, and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker. Our redemption, alſo, no leſs calls for the homage of our bodies than it does for the reverence and devotion of our ſouls. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Ye are bought with a price; therefore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in your bodies and your ſpirits, which are Gods.</hi> (1. Cor. 6.20.) Nay, if we expect the final glorification of both, 'tis but equal that they ſhould both conſpire in all the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36404:42"/>of vertue and religion, where both may contribute their ſeveral parts; That, ſo, ſince their intereſt is united, they may, in conjunction, work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling. Laſtly, The humble and decent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of our bodies, when we addreſs our ſelves to God, do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the internal devotion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of our minds; but, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the obſervation of all, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch as are unwilling to make the experiment) they excite, and continue our internal affections, recall our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, and put us in remembrance of what we are about, if we find (after an excurſion of our thoughts) that we are yet in the poſture of prayer; when otherwiſe, we might by the inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, or diverſion of our ſouls, or an unuſual heavineſs, and oppreſſion, in our bodies, forget the duty which we are converſant about. But eſpecially, in our publick devotions, the devout geſtures of others about us, mind us of what we ſhould do our ſelves; and we cannot remain cold and ſtupid, when we ſee others expreſs the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ardour of their minds, by thoſe actions in which we commonly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36404:42"/>repreſent them, when by the geſtures of their bodies they ſeem to pour out their very ſouls in prayer. How do we ſee the eyes of men ſparkle with zeal, when void of all paſſion or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrifie? How does humility, and ſome mens low conceits of themſelves cauſe their bodies to ſtoop, and their knees to bend? How does faith and hope, again, lift up the moſt feeble hands, at once to beg, and receive, Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? And ſuch devout actions (if they are not hypocritical) will raiſe and evidence our own affections; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, muſt certainly inflame others. To conclude this particular, then; I cannot but ſpeak of the external ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of our bodies, and the inward intention and fervour of our minds, what the Poets ſaid of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux;</hi> That when they are only ſingle they portend miſchief, and are the fore-runners of a Storm; But when they appear both together, they preſage a fortunate paſſage to the Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring piety in whom they ſhine, and a ſolid, and well grounded devotion. And thus I have done with the ſecond particular referring to the manner of our prayer, which relates to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36404:43"/>deportment and geſture of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt enquiry about the manner of our prayers, is to make a ſearch into our words and expreſſions, and to determine what is fitting to be done in this matter, when we ſpeak to ſo great and glorious a God; eſpecially in our joynt and common petitions. There are not more frequent extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies among men expoſed to the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of others, than what uſually proceed from the ſlipps, or deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, of our tongues. Theſe are ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when the body becomes heated and chafed, as if all our ſpirits flew thither, that 'tis difficult for ſome warm conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions to afford them any reſt at all; they are ſo talkative when we are awak'd, that they are tatling too whilſt we are aſleep. Therefore the skilful and prudent Government of the tongue is the moſt difficult task of the Empire within our ſelves, and needs the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a multitude of Laws, and a great and wary caution to be given us, that we may be very vigilant to ſtop the ſallies of it, that our words may be guided with diſcretion. <hi>The tongue</hi> (ſaies St. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>is a little member, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36404:43"/>boaſteth great things;</hi> and he compares it to <hi>fire,</hi> a ſpark of which often turns Cities into aſhes: ſuch is this among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, when it ſelf is kindled by the flames of Hell. <hi>And therefore if any man offend not in word</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>the ſame is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, and able to bridle the whole body.</hi> (James 3.2, 5, 6.) Now as this is ſo peccant in our converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with men, ſo is it apt to err in our converſes with God, when it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes too much familiarity with him, becoming pert and rude, in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and devotions. As ſome men, whom a Prince honours with his daily converſes, are ſo ſenſibly blown up with the reception of his breath, that their former Acquaintance muſt not know them; ſo, oftentimes, they become ſaucy to him that has advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, and blow his breath back upon himſelf, when they have firſt poyſoned it in their own bodies. And thus is it with many men in reference to the great God that made them, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſuch language in their addreſſes to him as would cauſe men to ſcorn,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36404:44"/>and reject, their petitions; and all for want of due conſideration, and impreſſing themſelves with a juſt aw from the diſtance, and diſproportion betwixt their Maker and themſelves. 'Tis true, indeed, we are exhorted to come with an humble boldneſs <hi>to the Throne of grace,</hi> ſince we have an acceptable perſon to intercede for us. (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16.) But who can think that ſuch a Text gives incouragement to duſt and aſhes, to fly againſt the face of their great Creator, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their priviledge into a confident rudeneſs? Rather, ſurely, the ſame Apoſtles ſober advice muſt give a check to extravagant preſumptions, and cauſe us to ſerve God in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable manner, with profound reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and a godly fear, <hi>becauſe he is a conſuming fire.</hi> (Heb. 12.28, 29.) To manage, therefore, our prayers unto God, in ſuch language as may be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our Maker and our ſelves; we may take, if we are willing, theſe following directions: (1.) That our words muſt be plain and intelligible. (2.) They ought to be grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. (3.) They muſt be expreſſive and full. (4.) They ought to be as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36404:44"/>brief and ſhort as may conſiſt with perſpicuity. And therefore, (Laſtly) they muſt be premeditated and fix'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our words and expreſſions in our ſolemn prayers muſt be plain and intelligible; Becauſe it is impoſſible that a man ſhould mind, however be affected with, that, which he does not underſtand; or if he is, 'tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, and he does not act like a man. We have, indeed, too me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and woful experience of ſome, that, being taken with muſical ſtroaks, and any thing which makes curious and grateful percuſſions upon their ears, are extreamly delighted with ſuch ſounds of words as are void of ſenſe: But 'tis a great miſtake if we think that the gratification of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes becomes a reaſonable ſervice unto God. Prayer requires that our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and wiſhes keep a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with our words, in which we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our wants and neceſſities: we may, otherwiſe, beg a Serpent, when we intend a Fiſh, and ask for a ſtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bread. If, in publick, we underſtand not the language of him that offers ſervice in our behalf, he may curſe us in the name of the Devil,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36404:45"/>when we think he bleſſes us in the name of God. It cannot, at the bare mention of it, but appear, to be a ſtrange and ridiculous ſervice, when we offer to God we know not what. And if we could truſt any man, with his bundle of infirmities, in a buſineſs of ſo great importance as our prayers ſo as to leave him either to his quick, or dull, invention, as his body or his mind is either vigorous or diſturbed, ſo that we might with any tolerable knowledge, or due conſideration, ſay Amen to what is uttered; or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us, by ſome men, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by our ſelves; yet, ſure I am, we can never proportion our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or the intention of out minds, ſuitable to thoſe expreſſions which we do not underſtand. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, eſpecially what is publick, ſhould be a plain thing, and worded ſo as to be underſtood by all that have been duly educated in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion; and therefore it muſt be ſtripped of all the gaudy luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riances of an Orator, not welted with Metaphors, nor darkned by any figurative alluſions; but it ought to be as naked as truth, as clear as the light,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36404:45"/>and as plain and open as innocence it ſelf. This muſt not be ſpoken, like the anſwers of the Oracles, in words that may beguile and deceive the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but it ought to be as plain as the queſtions of the inquirers were: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe let the language be what it will, 'tis but like a prayer in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, amuſing only, but not edifying, the Church; nor can any perſon, who does not apprehend it, rationally pronounce Amen to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſets his ſeal to a blank, which men will not do in other caſes; nay, for all that he knows, to that which binds him to his own ruin: And ſuch prayers S. <hi>Paul</hi> both redargues and condemns (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) Secondly, our words in prayer muſt be grave and ſerious, not intermixed with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of a Stage, as if our words and actions were to be theatrical in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a man were to make a raree ſhew in religion; we muſt not turn our devotions into a canting burleſque, nor cauſe the weighty conceptions of our ſouls to be breathed forth in air and fancy, as if we were courting a Miſtreſs, or a common Hall: But our prayers muſt be wiſe and grave, the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36404:46"/>buſineſs of thought, and careful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation, and our words muſt be ſuited to the weight and grandeur of the matter of our petitions. What a ſtrange thing is it to hear a, man beg by a Romance, and to adorn his rags with joques or flowers? This better proclaims his madneſs, than his wants. What an odd thing is it when a perſon comes to beg an alms, and yet rants a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36404:46"/>and had taken notes from the very Cripples; Nay, to a ſtranger that had ſeen and heard both, it would admit of ſome conſideration, to gueſs which was the inventor of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he would conclude both to be artificial, but neither to be fitting in the publick ſervice of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Nay, though we pray up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundations of promiſes, and Jeſus Chriſt has died for us; yet to urge Gods gracious and free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in ſuch daring and ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as if it had not been his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make them, or our obedience were ſo compleat that he could not ſuſpend the favours that we petition for, deſtroys that free grace which at other times we magnifie, and extol, in ſuch a manner, as to leave our ſelves little or no duty to perform. As if God muſt preſently be unjuſt to us if he does not, when we pleaſe, anſwer our petitions, and give us our reward. Strange! that men, in their addreſſes unto God, ſhould no better conſider their diſtance and dependance; but aſſume to themſelves ſuch familiarity with their Maker, as if they were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his equals or ſuperiors, thus rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36404:47"/>him of his glory that they may the better cloath themſelves with ſhame. But ſhall the potſherd fly at the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters head, or duſt and aſhes endeavour to cloud and obſcure heaven? ſhall we do thus, who are formed out of the clay, whom one word from him to whom we thus rudely addreſs, can ſentence to an everlaſting ſilence, and make the ſhades below our habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Nay, ſhall he, that can caſt our bodies into a grave, and our ſouls into moſt horrid darkneſs, in the twinkling of an eye, and both, at laſt, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings; who has the diſpoſal of all the bleſſings and miſeries of this life, and the eternal rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the next; ſhall he be addreſſed to, in ſuch a manner as if we were his familiar acquaintance? Certainly the moſt high and lofty one, the great God of heaven and earth, is not ſo ſmall and inconſiderable a thing as ſome mens prayers ſeem to make him. Let us hear himſelf arguing with ſuch rude and careleſs men: (Mal. 1.6.) <hi>A ſon</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth his Father, and a ſervant his Maſter; If I be, then, a Father, where is mine honour? And if I be a Maſter,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36404:47"/>where is my fear? ſaith the Lord of Hoſts unto you, O Prieſts! That deſpiſe my name, and yet ſay, wherein have we deſpiſed it?</hi> The Pſalmiſt gives excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent advice in ſuch a caſe as this: <hi>Serve the Lord with fear; nay, our very rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing muſt be with reverence.</hi> (Pſal. 2.11.) And if the great Kings and Judges of the earth, to whom <hi>David</hi> there ſpeaks, muſt thus perform their duty and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him who is higher than the higheſt; much more ought thoſe who are of a meaner allay to be admoniſhed not to be malepert with their Maker, leſt inſtead of favour they receive vengeance, and he gives no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their prayers, but a ſpeech of Hailſtones and coals of fire. Let men therefore uſe ſuch expreſſions in their addreſſes to God as may evidence ſome dread and awe upon their minds, and declare ſuch humility and reverence as become thoſe that draw nigh to God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> juſtified himſelf to the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Biſhops, by his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among them at all ſeaſons; but more eſpecially in that he had ſerved the Lord with all humility of mind: which they could no otherways diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, but by the outward agreement
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36404:48"/>of his words and actions, (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.19.) And ſince our words, in prayer, are only to expreſs our inward ſentiments, the thoughts and deſires of our ſouls, 'tis as requiſite, that they ſhould be grave and ſerious, as they ought to be modeſt and humble; and as neceſſary too as that our minds ſhould be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and adorned with ſuch vertues when we come to ſpeak, or preſent our ſelves, before the great Majeſty of the whole world. Nay, one is ſo natural a ſign of the other, that when gravity and humility are planted in the ſoul, they will ſprout forth, and ſpread their branches in the words of mens mouths, and deportment of their bodies: ſo that where theſe laſt things are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, nay, conclude, the profeſſion, or affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that men have the other to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ſham and a pretence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our words in prayer muſt be expreſſive and full: becauſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they anſwer not the end, for which they are uttered. For, ſince all our expreſſions in prayer, are not only to raiſe our devotions, ſuitable to the conceptions of our minds; but they are alſo deſigned to ſignifie the wiſhes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36404:48"/>and deſires of our ſouls, 'tis reaſonable that both ſhould run parallel, and our expreſſions equal our wants and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; or elſe our language cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the deſign of uttering words in prayer. I cannot deny, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the inward conceptions of men in private, may be too big for their mouths to expreſs; and there a ſigh, or a groan, may prevail with God, for what the tongue is not able fully to utter. <hi>There,</hi> as the Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> more clearly expreſſes it, <hi>they may mourn as a Dove, or chatter as a Crane;</hi> and he ſayes, <hi>'tis ſufficient in that condition.</hi> But, in publick prayers, when one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Orator for the reſt, petitions ought to be framed ſo, as to expreſs the general wants of thoſe that are preſent, as Chriſtians united into one body, being members in particular of that ſociety, of which Chriſt himſelf is the head; that all may be concerned in ſuch common requeſts, and joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with one heart, and with one ſoul; and with undivided affections, ſay <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſe and period.</p>
               <p>But yet, Fourthly, Our words in prayer muſt be as few, and our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as brief, as may conſiſt with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36404:49"/>and perſpicuity. Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is over and beyond this, ſeems redundant, and to no purpoſe, and therefore unreaſonable: nor only becauſe a tedious protraction, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary length in devotion dulls the ſpirits, and makes our affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active and ſtupid, (it quenching the fervor and intention of our minds) and turns much of our prayer, all whilſt we remain thus indiſpoſed, into meer babble and effuſion of words, when our minds cannot accompany our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, or the language of another uttered in our behalf. But, as we have no example of a tedious and long prayer in the Scriptures; ſo have we prohibitions and arguments againſt it. <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorting to external ſigns of reverence and devotion when men go to the houſe of God. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou on earth, therefore let thy words be few,</hi> (<hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 5.1, 2.) And if any one ſhould unreaſonably reſtrain this Text only to the ſubſequent vow; yet the argument urged why men ſhould be then ſparing of their words, will as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36404:49"/>well conclude in prayer as in vows, in both which things we ſpeak to ſuch a God as is in heaven, whilſt we ſtand at a diſtance on the earth. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours advice, in his Sermon on the Mount, is, <hi>when thou prayeſt, uſe not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking.</hi> And he preſently gives his own Diſciples the form of a full and moſt expreſſive prayer, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6 7.) Nay, if we will be inclined by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, (which any would think that Chriſtians ought) even then, when, by the circumſtances he was in, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his religion would conclude him to be devout, being fill'd with pain and fear of farther tortures that attended him, when he was in an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo great, <hi>that his ſweat was as it were</hi> large glutinous <hi>drops of blood;</hi> when, as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayes, <hi>his ſoul was ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even unto death;</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that <hi>he prayed more earneſtly.</hi> Even then we find his words to be no more than theſe; <hi>Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheleſs, not my will but thine be done,</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.42.) Nor did the earneſtneſs of his ſtrong deſire, force his thoughts to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36404:50"/>break out into a flood of expreſſions, but allowing himſelf ſome ſmall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, continuing his devotion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his prayer, repeating again the ſame words; (<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.44.) But I ſhall ſpeak more of theſe Texts hereafter. To proceed therefore, to ſhew, that brevity is an ornament to our prayers; the very nature and uſual cuſtom of petitions, will bring a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient convincing teſtimony to all thoſe, who have not very odd conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the object to whom they make religious addreſſes. Theſe, by the reaſon of men, are then judged to be beſt drawn, when they include bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and fulneſs of matter; and the ſhorter do we uſually frame them, by how much the greater the perſon is, to whom they are to be preſented: And the reaſon of this may poſſibly be, not only, becauſe the ſerious affairs of great men, that are in publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, will not permit much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but for that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be wiſe and diſcerning, able to underſtand quicker than thoſe who are placed in a more vulgar ſtation. A breviat may be ſufficient to inform ſome men, when others muſt be large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36404:50"/>inſtructed from point to point; and muſt have things variouſly diverſified, and often reiterated, before they will ſuit with their apprehenſions. And ſhall we think, the Omniſcient God, who knows our wants before we peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be leſs intelligent, or compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, than men, that he ſtands in need of ſo many words, and variety of expreſſions, to cauſe him to underſtand, or to incline him to grant what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for us? But this will be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in a larger manner in the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the whole diſcourſe. And therefore this head ſhall be concluded with a brief anſwer to one plea which may be made for a long continued prayer. The objection is, that our Saviour was engaged all night in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (<hi>Luke</hi> 6.12.) and ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and examples too, we have in the Scriptures, that may import and ſignifie ſome length in prayer. But, if we conſider them; and were either upon extraordinary occaſions, or ſo circumſtantiated, that they differed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly from our preſent ſtate, and cannot be a pattern unto us: Or elſe when Chriſt or his Apoſtles continued long in prayer, by giving themſelves
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36404:51"/>ſhort reſpits, and allowing ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals between, they returned to the ſame prayers again, which might be ſhort enough for all the objection. Yet when we have the ſame Spirit, and meaſures of aſſiſtance, with ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and revelations as the had, and fall under their circumſtances, (which can never be); their extraordinary practice may become a copy for our imitation. In the mean time, ſince it is moſt ſuitable to the reaſon of prayer, with reference to God, a greeable to our natural and unavoidable infirmities, and that infinite diſtance betwixt our Maker and our ſelves; it is fitting that our prayers ſhould be as brief and ſhort as may conſiſt with plainneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity.</p>
               <p>And therefore, Laſtly, Upon the view of all this, it is convenient, and, for the moſt part, neceſſary too, that both the matter and expreſſions of our prayers ſhould be fixed and premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. For if our words in prayer ought to be plain and intelligible; if they muſt be both grave and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerious; if they ought to be full in the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our wants; and if they muſt be as brief and ſhort, as may conſiſt with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36404:51"/>perſpicuity; how can it be poſſible, that the quickeſt men, ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infirmities in their bodies, that muſt and will, many times, cloud their minds, ſhould, upon a ſudden, without a previous and exact conſideration, word their own, and the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of other men, according to the order, and method, and importance of things, unleſs they have, before hand, invented, digeſted, and reduced both their matter and expreſſions into a well ſtudied and ſet form of prayer: He that adventures to pray <hi>extempore</hi> in a publick audience, is ſo ſelfiſh in the matter of his petitions, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ridiculous in the expreſſions, that it is impoſſible all ſhould be able to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſeveral things petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for, if they at all uſe their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and do not implicitly joyn upon the authority of the gifted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But you will find more of this, in a place of this Diſcourſe, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly reſerved for it. I do not deny, but matter and words may preſent themſelves on a ſudden for private and more brief ejaculations, or intermix themſelves in our ſingle devotions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the form which we may general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36404:52"/>uſe; either through the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of our minds and affections, or upon ſudden and unexpected neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, or by recollecting in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſomething that was either before omitted, or our form does not directly enough, or in particulars expreſs. But in publick, where petitions ought to be ſo general, that all preſent may ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and by this ſignifie their aſſent and wiſhes, it is not only convenient, but neceſſary too, that men ſhould have ſome time to judge, and be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with what is delivered in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, before they give their aſſent to it; otherwiſe they pray not with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and underſtanding, which ought to go before, and lead their affections, and not permit the paſſions to ſally forth, without taking notice of it in the way. Now I cannot ſee, how this can poſſibly be done, without a form, which thoſe that joyn in may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. However, methink, to us Chriſtians, there are ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be taken from univerſal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in former ages, and reaſons alſo from the holy Scriptures, which are ſufficient, to determine us in this affair, and to recommend this method of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36404:52"/>our ſelves to Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The antiquity of publick forms of prayers, and benedictions, wherein alſo prayer is included, is ſo evident, that both Jews and Chriſtians have agreed in this, notwithſtanding the introduction of the one religion ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded and evacuated the other. Under the Law, we find the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a form by God himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Prieſts were to bleſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by invocating and wiſhing that Gods bleſſing might deſcend upon them, and they were the authoritative inſtruments, in this method, to convey it to them, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Nay, there is a form of prayer made and preſcribed by the ſame God for thoſe to rehearſe who had payed their tythe, every third year; as any one may ſee both the form, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to uſe it, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 26. from <hi>v.</hi> 12. onward). What are the Books of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> but a form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Petitions, and Thankſgivings, which were uſed in the worſhip of God in the Temple, delivered to the Levites, in the ſeveral Quires, according to the Ordinance of the King of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> When
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36404:53"/>they ſang together by courſe, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and giving thanks unto the Lord, <hi>becauſe he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever?</hi> (<hi>Ezra</hi> 3.10, 11.). Nay, and what ſeems to me matter of wonder, theſe very <hi>Pſalms</hi> tranſlated into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Metre, are yet ſung in thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Congregations, who refuſe otherwiſe to pray to God by a form. But to leave the form preſcribed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and accordingly practiſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to ſome men of quick invention, and volubility of language, they were a carnal and an heavy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be led on in a dull and formal way. Yet unleſs the oppoſers of forms of prayer, will be too nimble for the Apoſtles themſelves, and account them dull and carnal; we ſhall find forms in the New Teſtament, not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but injoyned too. None ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be unacquainted, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour taught his Diſciples to pray; and gave them a form, not only for imitation, but for uſe; men do not, I hope, ſo learn, Chriſt, 'Tis true, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> delivers the command, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner therefore pay ye,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.): yet S. <hi>Luke,</hi> recording the ſame prayer, when in another year, and on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36404:53"/>another occaſion, our Saviour delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, gives us the account of our Lords preſcription, in theſe words <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Luke</hi> 11.1.). Yet this difference can only infer theſe two things, (1.) That, in all our compoſures of prayer, in which we enlarge the words of our petitions, ſuitable to the enlargement of our minds, we ſhould have regard, and bear ſome proportion to this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern which Chriſt himſelf has given for our direction; And (2.) That we ſhould uſe alſo the words themſelves in which our Saviour has taught us to pray; ſupplying the imperfections of our own invention, by the fulneſs of that prayer, which he has preſcribed for all true Christians to uſe. And ſuch a method we find followed by the Church, till the vanity of ſome men, who thought themſelves wiſer (and they may be accounted more fanciful) than the aged, deſigned to ſuit their expreſſions and tones, to captivate the affections and paſſions of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for ends at firſt beſt known to themſelves; but ſince, with a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, declared to others. Though in the mean time they offered unto God
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36404:54"/>fancy for devotion, and, out of their pretended wiſdom, the ſacrifice of fools: And I pray God there be no Knavery in it, that was alſo intended to the people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I argue for forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be uſed in publick, becauſe the Miniſter then is the mouth of the congregation, and is to be ſuppoſed to utter all by their conſent, and to pray in their names, teſtifying their unity of affection, by their conſent in prayer. And this ſo prevails with the great God of infinite goodneſs, <hi>that if but two ſhall agree together on earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done, for them by the Father which is in heaven.</hi> (Matth. 18.19.) Unity of affection and conſent in prayer, is that which renders our publick devotions ſo acceptable to God. This gives them ſtrength and vertue, cauſes our prayers to aſcend as incenſe, and the lifting up of our hands to be as an evening ſacrifice. Now there cannot, in my opinion, be this conſent, and unity of affection in prayer, but where there is an uniformity in calling upon God; that all, let them come whence they will into any publick
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36404:54"/>place of devotion, where a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is aſſembled to offer their joynt prayers to God, (if they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and frequent the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) being before acquainted with the ſervice and prayers which all there make to God, they may unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves immediately to them, and ſay Amen, to teſtifie their conſent; And if any thing be paſs'd over before they come, being morally aſſured from the continual cuſtom and uſe there, eſpecially the Miniſter being pre-enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, both by an oath, and ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties attending the violation, to uſe no other form of worſhip, than what is preſcribed in the common Rubricks and prayers of the Church; I ſay, if any of the prayers are paſſed over, by uniting in, the reſt, with an eaſie recollection of what has been already uttered, a man being acquainted with it by common uſe, may, at leaſt better than by any other method, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done in extemporary effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, joyn himſelf to the congregation, and obtain ſome intereſt in the whole ſervice; And eſpecially if, under theſe circumſtances, he is heartily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the prayer of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:36404:55"/>and ſome others in the concluſion of our worſhip; and yet, pray with ſome good underſtanding; though it cannot be ſo well as if he had conſented, from part to part, with all; and he may not depart without a bleſſing, if it were not a wilfull omiſſion, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but only a miſtake of time, and a misfortune.</p>
               <p>But if this reaſoning will not prevail; yet. Thirdly, I argue the lawfulneſs and expedience of forms of prayer, from the great example of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. (And certainly Chriſtians ought not to think that they can imitate a better). For we find him, in his agony in the Garden, when his ſoul was ſorrowful even unto death, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied miſeries oppreſſed and tortured him, to uſe only this ſhort prayer; <hi>O my Father! if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me: Nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> (Matth. 26.39.) And when, upon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he returned again to his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we read that he uſed the ſame prayer; and the Evangeliſt has very little altered the phraſe; which yet our Saviour ſeemed not to change at all. For when be informs us that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36404:55"/>he prayed the third time, he tells us that he uſed the ſame words, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.44.) However, if this inſtance may miſcarry, as I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould; yet 'tis plain, that when he was tortured upon the Croſs, and in the height of his paſſion invocated God, his words were a form long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed by <hi>David;</hi> and it was a part, if not the whole of the 22. Pſalm, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, I argue for let forms of prayer from the practice of S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and his Diſciples, who proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly borrowed it (as Mr, <hi>Mede</hi> in his <hi>Diatribae</hi> hints) from a cuſtom among the Doctors of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to deliver ſome certain forms of prayer, to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as a badge and ſymbol of their diſcipleſhip. However it fares with this notion; yet, 'tis evident that the Baptiſt himſelf (who, the Scripture ſayes, was more than a Prophet) did preſcribe ſome form of prayer for his followers to uſe, though we find not upon record, what it was; yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it might be a prayer near the ſenſe and expreſſions of that of our Lord; for his form, as to words and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36404:56"/>phraſes, was before in the Jewiſh forms, a little varied; and therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> infers that the Great Lord of the Chriſtian Church was very far from all affectation of any novelty, which was not neceſſary. But, to let theſe things paſs; The Scripture it ſelf plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informs us that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did give his Diſciples a form, by which he taught them to pray. For when our Saviour had, as the Text declares, in a certain place ended his own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; one of his Diſciples petitioned him to teach them to pray, as <hi>John</hi> alſo taught his Diſciples. And our Saviour preſently, without any other intervening diſcourſe, replies in anſwer to his deſire, <hi>When ye pray, ſay Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. (Luk. 11.1, 2.) So that either Chriſt's is not a form, although it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be uſed, which no man of ſenſe can ſay; or our Saviour eluded the requeſt of his Diſciple, in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a part of it, but not the whole, which no Chriſtian will be bold to affirm; or if he did at that time teach his own Diſciples to pray as, or in that manner, as <hi>John</hi> alſo taught his, then it muſt be neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36404:56"/>infer'd that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a form for his followers to pray by.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is no inconvenience, but great advantage in a ſtudied, and ſet, form of prayer; when extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and unpremeditated devotions, uttered in preſent and ſudden lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, can neither evade the one, nor be the inſtrument of the other. Studied forms of prayer may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered often, and receive the cenſures and corrections of many wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, before they are expoſed to common judgment; and they that are to joyn in them, upon view of them before hand, may be able to ſuit their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the intentions of their minds, both to the matter, and alſo the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in extemporary prayers they cannot do, but muſt on a ſudden be bound up to the matter, words, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of another; that I may not ſay, to the broken ſenſe, extravagant phraſes, dark Metaphors, frequent interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or bodily infirmities diſtracting, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, another man; or to the effects of thoſe fears or inadvertencies, that may often attend a man bewildred through worldly cares, or diſturbed with the thoughts and troubles of his mind.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36404:57"/>Forms of prayer, ſtudied and reviewed, are not ſubject to ſuch impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, tautologies, and vain repetitions, that too ſudden effuſions frequently produce, when there is a defect in the invention of matter, fluency of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or apt words to expreſs the petitions men are willing to preſent. Nay, the moſt ignorant and illiterate may, by the frequent audience of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſet forms of prayer, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their memories, by the due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and affection of their minds, when theſe are devoutly and diſtinctly pronounced, by the Miniſter of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or the Maſter of a Family, fix and remember ſome things and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for their more private and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle uſe, and at laſt be able to expreſs their ſupplications to God for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate relief of their neceſſities, and in this the publick language of the Church, when no ſuch thing can poſſibly be accompliſhed, by hearing the ſame matter variouſly phraſed, and ſuch expreſſions as are alter'd and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in reſpect of order and poſition of words, and intermixed with new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and obſcurities, and frequent jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and interpoſitions of confeſſions,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36404:57"/>and thankſgivings, and words that, declaring the excellencies of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke men to acts of adoration or rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the midſt of what methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be prayer and petitions. So that they who poſſeſs the room of the unlearned, if they were able with due judgment and affection to keep pace with him who, in this way, can invent and utter prayer, with neither; yet they can no more carry away what may aſſiſt them in their private retirements, than the gifted man is able afterwards to remember and repeat his own prayer. For, in theſe ſudden and upremeditated effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men in their prayers unto God, their inventions ſo vary the phraſes, and tranſpoſe the matter, that when all is the ſame, yet, they are ſo differently placed between antecedents and conſequents, that they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently altered, till they become obſcure; and are ſo clouded either with Fogs or Duſt, that a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man of parts and memory is not able to find either out, when they are buried in the midſt of rubbiſh; and how ſhould another ſearch out that which he that hid it cannot find?</p>

               <p>Sixthly, If forms of prayer in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick devotions are either inconvenient, or unlawful; then they muſt be ſo in relation to the perſons that utter them, or elſe to thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in joyning with, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them : (1.) If they are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, or unlawful to the Miniſter only; why ſhould the people trouble themſelves, or any man ſtartle them about it? Unleſs men think it to be a glory to them to diſturb the minds and Religion of the devout; raiſe clouds, that they may have the honour to diſpel them; bring ſcruples and pains into mens conſciences, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſtical Divinity may come the more into faſhion, and they, like Quacks, may ſit gravely in their Chairs to ſcry waters, and reſolve doubts, and take Fees of their wandring Patients. This is plain forcing of a Trade, and making men ſick, that they may cure the diſeaſe, or rather live by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it. For why ſhould the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perplex their minds about that in which only the Miniſter is concerned? Let every man bear his own burden; and in this caſe, relating to publick worſhip, we are willing, and chuſe,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36404:59"/>to bear ours. <hi>For the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Father, nor the Father of the Son: The righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him,</hi> (Ezek. 18.20.). Yet certainly he who has duly conſidered that intention of mind, which is to accompany the matter and expreſſions of our prayers, will not charge a Miniſter with a fault, becauſe he cannot effect that which is impoſſible, to mind three or four things at the ſame inſtant; inventing matter and words to expreſs it, at the ſame time, in which he muſt reflect upon what he has invented, before he can underſtand it himſelf; and raiſe his affections and deſires in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what he utters when he prayes, and direct his intentions to the great God, to whom he addreſſes. Or elſe thoſe that are ſo much for theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary effuſions muſt conclude that the Miniſter need not pray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whilſt he is buſie in inventing matter and words for others; but that it is ſufficient that he teaches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be devout, when he himſelf has no devotion at all; and that his buſineſs in the congregation is to make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36404:60"/>prayers for others, not for himſelf. (2.) If a form of prayer be either inconvenient or unlawful to the people, then indeed all the former reaſoning is ineffectual, and more will be ſo, which is yet behind; But then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aſſerts this, as none but a mad man will without limitation do; I have this, farther, in this place to urge againſt him, that there muſt be no publick prayer at all. For all prayer is either uttered in words that are premeditated or conceived before; and this, on all hands will be yielded to be a form. Or elſe it muſt be delivered in ſuch language, promoted by what helps ſoever, as he that pronounces it did not think of before he is call'd to utter it, which they that affect it, call either praying <hi>extempore,</hi> or by the ſpirit: but whatever of this nature is uttered by a Miniſter, in a publick congregation, will, howſoever, be a ſet form to the people. For both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words muſt be framed and fixed by the Miniſters invention, and pronounced too, before they come to the peoples ears; they muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and conſider them before they can rationally conſent to the petitions,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36404:60"/>and, with earneſt wiſhes, ſay Amen; And conſequently, whatever 'tis to the Miniſter, (which, though I have the faculty, I cannot know, unleſs I were an Enthuſiaſt, reaſon and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity being wholly excluded by a late Writer in this caſe) it muſt be all one to the people, whether the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be premeditated or <hi>extempore.</hi> But, the truth is, they who manage this controverſie, on that ſide oppoſite to our Church, turn their dark parts to us, as the Moon does before a Change; and like the little Foxes that ſpoil our vines, whilſt the grapes yet hang ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the branches, are ſo hard hunted in this matter, that, after they have run out at length ſeveral miles from the place, where they were firſt unkennel'd, they are fain to take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Woods, march upon dead, or quick-ſet, hedges, and at laſt will have no refuge but to earth themſelves, when the darkneſs of the night hinders their being digg'd out again. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if, in the mean time, we well watch and obſerve theſe perſons, we may find them out by the light of the morning, when they thump and digg to make their way through; And for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36404:61"/>greater part (though ſome are of a more quick and crafty invention) if we well obſerve the frequent prayers of any one man pretending this gift, we ſhall find it to be either the effect of a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, quick invention, with volubility of language pronounced with an endearing tone in Scripture phraſes canted to the people; or elſe an art of expreſſing himſelf, by the ſtrength of memory, or frequent uſe, moſt readily, and ſometimes, though not always, prudently, in phraſes and ſentences diverſified and tranſpoſed, according to the various poſitions of the matter, and to be a faculty only of amuſing, but not edifying, the people, making grateful percuſſions on their ears, and ſcrewing up their affections by turning round the wheels, and all to be but mechanical Clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, or a Jack to roaſt meat for their own bellies. For how often have we heard theſe gifted men pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pray in an unpremeditated me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or none at all, as the fruit of a ſudden and quick invention, whilſt they were willing it ſhould be believed that all, even their very matter and words, were darted into them by the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36404:61"/>ſpirit of God, that all might be ſhot back to heaven; yet, upon wiſe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection by memory and obſervation, we have concluded that their nimble effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have conſiſted of many pieces of ſet forms jumbled together, (like <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi>'s atoms) by a fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; or at leaſt of many precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſentences expreſſing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of former petitions in a new dreſs, diverſified by art, varied and fixed in divers places, as they preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the memory or the fancy, ſo that this is often like the changing of bells, and may be managed by the ſame art; four will make four and twenty, and upon five they may ring ſix ſcore. I ſhall leave this therefore, at preſent, as a point that deſerves no farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration among any religious men that are thinking and wiſe; but ſhall proceed on to the enquiries which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main that may be of more general uſe and benefit.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the fifth head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be diſcourſed on; to make enquiry into what religious and devout men ought to pray for; that the matter of our petitions may be ſuch as comports with wiſdom, and prudence, and the general rules of Gods word, as well as the matter lawful and convenient. Now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large this particular, by mentioning all thoſe things which the peculiar or accidental wants of men may make neceſſary to become the ſubject of Chriſtian petitions, would not only ſwell and enlarge this head of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe beyond its juſt bounds and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; but alſo far exceed my skill; and I fancy, any bodies elſe; even the quick'ſt and moſt artificial extemporary mans, though he were never ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative, and formally grave; unleſs he might have a faculty of omniſcience, which more ignorant mortals cannot find in themſelves. For though we might be able (without inſpiration) to inſtance in all thoſe general matters that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36404:62"/>might be fitting to be ingredients into our Common prayer, which we are to uſe in ſociety with others, as we are all members of one body, of which Chriſt is the glorious and ſupream head, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the remaining part of his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory office; yet, the conditions, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and imployments of mens lives as they are individual, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct form each other, are ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and diverſified, that 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for one man, unleſs he could know and experience the concernments of all, to enumerate the particulars that, one time or other, ought to become the ſubject matter of ſingle mens pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; For a man may beg what is convenient or neceſſary for himſelf, that may be to anothers great damage; which, if improved but a little in its length, will be a great argument againſt ſuch particular confeſſions, thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and prayers too, as are offered in behalf of a large multitude from the view of a ſingle mans particular ſins, favours received, or wants, that he needs a ſupply for, when few, or none, or, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all cannot in judgment aſſent to. And therefore, as to the matter of ſingle mens petitions, no other rules can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36404:63"/>but what may ſuit, ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the common frailties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of men; and we muſt leave their various and preſent neceſſities, or what they, upon a probable proſpect, view, to influence themſelves, aſſiſted by the rules and aids of the holy Spirit, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, with the help of their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to direct them in the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affair of petitioning God with reference to themſelves. However, in general, we are to pray for temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal bleſſings: yet not without ſome difference of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the firſt, being leſs neceſſary, and inferiour alſo to the other two ought to be petitioned for, with a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of ardency and affection, and at all times in ſubſerviency to the latter. Now in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch things as are the lawful ſubject of our prayers, we muſt petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the removal of all impediments that may obſtruct the poſſeſſion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe good things, which we ask o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God, from whom comes every good and perfect gift; And theſe are, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, our ſins and temptations, and the evil ends to which we may deſign the bleſſings themſelves, when once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36404:63"/>Further, we muſt in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers beg thoſe aſſiſtances and helps which God has promiſed, to incourage the means in the obtainment of any lawful deſign; and theſe are the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his bleſſing, and the aids of his holy Spirit. Such things as theſe, as they are the purchace of the blood of Chriſt, and graciouſly promiſed, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, to thoſe who qualifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their reception; ſo any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being the foundation of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we may ask the thing included in it without ſin or danger, provided we underſtand the promiſe a right; and we ſhall receive a gracious anſwer to our petition, if we ask not amiſs, or the thing prayed for may be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or neceſſary at that time. And this is all that I intend to ſay, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to thoſe general rules, to guide our devout prayers by, according to which, we may take ſome meaſure of our particular wants, and diſcern the lawful matter of our petitions. But ſince we are to pray for perſons alſo, as well as things, and not only for our ſelves but others; univerſal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the precept of loving our neighbours as our ſelves, will ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36404:64"/>conclude that, in general, the matter of our prayers for others muſt be the ſame (only <hi>mutato nomine</hi>) with the petitions for our ſelves; and will only admit of ſome variation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the change of circumſtances and relations; And therefore I ſhall add no new directions, but what may eaſily be collected from the former. I need not, I hope, pretend to remember, much leſs to inform, Chriſtian men that they muſt pray for Kings, and all in authority; for parents and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, for the houſhold of faith, or the converſion of Infidels; for the Miniſters of Gods Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of what degree ſoever, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe to whom originally was committed the government and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Chriſts Church upon earth; for the proſperity of thoſe from whom we receive our education and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or any of the conveniences of this life, if they are living: The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal race of mankind muſt ſome way or other have an intereſt in our prayers. <hi>I exhort</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that, firſt of all, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men: for Kjngs, and all that are in authority,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36404:64"/>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty; For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> (1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3.) Such things as theſe, if we duly and ſincerely practiſe, will cauſe our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to aſcend to heaven, like incenſe it ſelf, whoſe ſmoak joyned and pierc'd the clouds, and approached even the Throne of God. And as the juſt, here, live by faith, ſo muſt they live and die in prayer; as the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> with her wings, kindles her own funeral pile, and then dies in the midſt of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding theſe general directions and rules, we muſt needs fail in the matter of our prayers, if we ſhould, at any time, petition thoſe for our ſelves, or others, which things God has either forbidden us to ask, or, however, not promiſed to grant. If we pray for what he has forbidden us to ask, we then ſin againſt his command, and then our ſacrifice becomes our ſin, and the motives to it are a perfect ſnare. And if we pray for what he has never promiſed to grant, we cannot, then, pray in faith; becauſe we cannot, without preſumption, believe that we ſhall receive that, in virtue of our
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36404:65"/>prayer, which God has never ingaged to give, and 'tis plain impudence to expect from him that he will make ſuch returns to our petitions. Nay, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>let not that man think that he ſhall receive any thing from the Lord, who does not ask in faith;</hi> but, for want of Gods promiſe, muſt waver in his hope, and he has ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect his ſucceſs. (<hi>James</hi> 1.6, 7.) To make Gods promiſe the foundation of our petitions, will hinder our prayers from interfering with his will, to which our deſires muſt always be ſubjected, by the eminent example of our Saviour himſelf, even when he prayed for the diverſion of his paſſion. <hi>Nevertheleſs, not my will, but thine be done.</hi> (Luk. 22.42.) And this is ſuitable to a comprehenſive petition in that prayer, which he gave to his Diſciples, and in and by them commanded all Chriſtians to uſe, and imitate: <hi>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</hi> Now this excludes three things from being the ſubject matter of our prayers. (1.) Such as are not neceſſary to us in that rank and ſtation, in which we live, or, if it may be better expreſſed, according to the figure we make in the world. For the prayer for other
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36404:65"/>things above us argues nothing leſs than covetouſneſs and ambition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves, and then we regard iniquity in our hearts, and being thus poſſeſſed, the Lord will not hear us. Such petitions are directed to a wrong end, the things we ask being ſuperfluous to us in that condition in which God has placed us, wherewith we ought to be content. Our prayers muſt not exceed our ſtation, 'till Gods providence moves us to an higher ſeat. (2.) Thoſe things muſt be excluded from our prayers that are inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for God to grant, or for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Some things which may be lawful in themſelves, without refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to circumſtances attending, may yet be ſo unſuitable to Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in governing the world, that the conceſſion of them may thwart and contradict it. Again, other things may be unlawful for us to receive; Becauſe ſuch may be our tempers and diſpoſitions, that, when we poſſeſs them, we may prove troubleſome to our ſelves, or very great diſturbers of others. For ſome men that may be quiet, peaceable, and kept in order, in a lower degree, may prove factious
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36404:66"/>and turbulent, when mounted into an higher Sphere; 'Tis true, we have heard of a Dictator drawn from the Plough tail, who yet has behaved himſelf excellently in his office; and we have had ſome good Biſhops, who never knew what 'twas to be a Pariſh Prieſt: But rare examples will not annul general obſervation, when Divine providence makes men leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeats of honour; God overlooks the whole world, and orders the parts with reference to the whole; His ways are oftentimes unſearchable, and his paths paſt finding out. Yet this we are aſſured of, that as power and authority diſcovers the diſpoſition of him that has it, though his low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition might hide it before; ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may be modeſt and humble, whileſt God keeps them in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior order, may become proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, when they are placed under a Canopy of honour, and have a larger confluence of the things of this world, and may turn the grace of God into wantonneſs: And if God ſhould grant ſuch mens petitions, as ſometimes he does, in anger to them, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, or for many deſigns
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36404:66"/>hidden from us; we uſually find this true, that <hi>Aſperius nihil eſt, &amp;c.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch things muſt be excluded from the matter of our prayers, that tend to the promotion of our own ſins, the ſupporting the wretched tyranny of the Devil, or the cruel oppreſſions of wicked men. <hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, his countenance doth behold the upright.</hi> (Pſal. 11.7.) And we cannot expect that prayers, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things that are contrary to this, ſhould find any acceptance with God, <hi>who is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity,</hi> or beſtow things upon the children of men, that may Sſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the hands of wickedneſs, or give incouragement to their ſins. From all which we may eaſily conjecture why God, many times, ſuſpends his anſwers, or denies our requeſts. As he does afflict his people in faithfulneſs; ſo does he, in kindneſs, reject their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as well as grant, or deny ſome in wrath. For ſometimes we are not in a preſent capacity to receive what we ask, and moſt earneſtly deſire. We frequently come to the houſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when yet our ſins lay at the door, and moſt abominable hypocriſie lodges
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36404:67"/>in our hearts. We have not, many times, prepared our ſouls according to the preparation of the Sanctuary, but either for want of humility, or charity, we muſt leave our gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar, or when we offer it we do not perform it with true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ſuitable and earneſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our minds. We oftentimes pray amiſs, and ſo loſe the fruit of our requeſts, nay, we fail not only in the deſigns of our prayers, but even in the manner of performance. We are not like the importunate Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which Parable was delivered to this end, to encourage men always to pray and not to faint. (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1.). Or elſe we do not, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, joyn alms with our prayers; for theſe are an admirable preparative to devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or an excellent concluſion to cloſe our petitions with, they help to lift up our deſires to heaven, being ſuch a ſacrifice <hi>with which God is well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> (Heb. 13.16.) Or elſe we come before the Maker of the world with ſome great ſin waſting our conſciences, which we have not confeſs'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and the fear of this may juſtly contract our hearts, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36404:67"/>our ſpirits, and whilſt this hovers over our heads, we cannot ſee to the God that made us, nor to him who is the Redeemer of our ſouls, and therefore wanting faith, our petitions can neither be accepted or anſwered; Our ſin, that we have not repented of, hangs over us as a thick cloud, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring our prayers from aſcending to heaven, and intercepts the favours and mercies of God, cauſing them to recoil back to himſelf. Nay, we too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approach his preſence with hearts ungrateful for the mercies we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and though we have obtained, what Divine Providence, both in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, and temporals, flowing from infinite wiſdom and power, has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thought fitting to beſtow, we, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being thankful for our receipts, murmur and repine, becauſe we have no more. Like perſons here below, we are perpetually grumbling at the Governments of this World, becauſe we have not what we wiſh for, though perhaps we have more than we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. And further, as this is a great argument, that we take not the true meaſures of our ſelves; ſo we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely willing that Gods thoughts
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36404:68"/>ſhould be like our own, rather than our wiſhes ſhould be regulated by his wiſdom; And therefore he frequently denies our requeſts in prayer, becauſe, being guided by our narrow and ſhort proſpect of things, we ſometimes ask that which, if granted, would prove our ruin. <hi>For</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,) <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought,</hi> (Rom. 8.26.) We have not the juſt view of our ſelves, and cannot with certainty ſee what is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we know not what a day may bring forth. God, therefore, who is acquainted with our frame, and is able to look through future contingencies, ſuch as are ſo in their natural Cauſes, but foreſeen by him, who is the God of nature, who ſees which way the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance will incline, becauſe he knows the paths of his own Providence: this great God, as he many times ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends his favours, till we are in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to receive them; ſo, like a tender Father, he will not give us bread to ſpoil, nor a Serpent to ſting us. And therefore, ſometimes, when he accepts our prayers, he adapts his favours to our neceſſities; now giving us more than we ask, and then cutting his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36404:68"/>ſhort of our petitions, becauſe he, in his infinite wiſdom, knows, that we ask too much: He wiſely conſiders, what ſtore-houſe we have, and our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of receiving what we pray for, and changes the ſeaſons, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to beſtow his gifts, and confers them according to the good pleaſure of his will, and his moſt wiſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in governing the World, and us, as members of this great Community. And therefore, ſometimes he gives us one thing more convenient, when we moſt earneſtly beg another; now changing the means which we deſire to obtain an end, affording other that may be more effectual; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, he changes the end it ſelf, and orders the means we have petitioned for, in order to one deſign, to produce what is better, and much more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us; yet, in all theſe things, he acts beſt, becauſe he does that which is moſt convenient for us, and moſt ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Wiſdom, and Providence. Finally, we may petition for many things, which, if granted to us, would thwart God's general Government of the World, or ſome particular wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which we are yet ignorant of; and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36404:69"/>therefore, in ſuch caſes, he accepts our prayer as an acknowledgement to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he does not grant the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it. Or, Laſtly, we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beg ſuch things as may prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to our own, or others ſins; and then, 'tis no wonder, that he denies our requeſts, <hi>becauſe we ask amiſs, that we may conſume it on our luſts or pleaſures,</hi> (James 4.3.) And thus I have finiſhed my fifth Enquiry into what things men ought to pray for.</p>

               <p>I Proceed now to the Sixth Head propounded to be treated of in this diſcourſe; To enquire into the latitude of prayer, with reference to thoſe who are to perform, and joyn in it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find what is called <hi>the Spirit of Prayer,</hi> confined, by ſome, to thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who are endowed with the Spirit of God; nay ſo, as if that ſpake in them: And, by their ſelecting and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling members for their religious ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Churches, ſo called, out of the viſible profeſſors of Chriſtianity, who having been baptized, were made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Church upon earth, that they deſign to have Saints only to partake of publick Ordinances among them, as well as they can; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit, or elſe exclude others. I ſhall therefore, in this Chapter, briefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether prayer be an univerſal duty, or only concerns good men, or true Saints? Now, though ſuch a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36404:70"/>upon a naked propoſal, a man would think, might be, on a ſudden, anſwered; and a return might be made as extemporary, as ſome mens prayers are, or the Books of thoſe, who only Hem, and Spit them forth, with little or no conſideration: yet it muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome debate, for that the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of times, and the perverſe wits of ſome men, have rendered it uſeful, and neceſſary too: Becauſe, we find ſome thinking and melancholy men, (unleſs they are perſons who deſerve a more ſevere denomination) even, in this lower world, endeavouring to make a ſeparation neceſſary betwixt the <hi>Tares</hi> and the <hi>Wheat,</hi> though our Saviour ſayes, <hi>Let both grow together until the Harveſt,</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.30.)

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36404:70"/>inadvertency, or wicked diſpoſition of one man, cannot hinder the acceptance of the devotion of another, if there be any communion in prayer through the world, that is publick in a congregated aſſembly: no more than the vain glory of the Phariſee obſtructed the Petition of the humble Publican: or, to come full home to the point; than <hi>Judas</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the grateful ſervices of Chriſts Diſciples, becauſe he was one of the twelve. Nay, a contrary notion, and in purſuance of it, a forbearance of all joint petitions, till we were aſſured, that no wicked man were among us, would deſtroy all publick, and family, prayers: Becauſe we cannot have ſuch an aſſurance; and we can, in this caſe, at moſt, make only probable conjectures; unleſs thoſe men will pretend to know the hearts of others, who, if we may believe themſelves, are ignorant of their own; and quote a Text, according to their own ſenſe, to confirm it. That <hi>the heart of man is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.). But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, there are ſome caſes, in which, the great God will not hear, though good men intercede and pray.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36404:71"/>As, when the moſt of a community have fallen into, and yet continue, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately enough, in the commiſſion of ſuch crying ſins, that a general cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is judged, by divine wiſdom, fit to be brought upon it, for the utter ruine of the members, when an irrevocable ſentence is gone forth againſt them; if further conſideration does not bring them to repentance, and the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their lives. Then, though <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in it, they ſhall neither deliver Son nor Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they ſhall, at moſt, only deliver their own ſouls by their righteouſneſs, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.20.) Yet their goodneſs and prayers may avail, even in ſuch a day, to the reſcue of themſelves. But to come nearer to the point in hand; we find, in ſome other caſes, where Gods ſentence is not abſolute, but conditional, and there yet remains ſome hopes of repentance, that wicked mens prayers have been heard for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they have reſolved to amend for the future. And this was the caſe of that great and vaſt City of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> whoſe ſin was ſo lofty and aſpiring, that it pierced the Clouds, and aſcended before the Throne of God: yet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36404:71"/>when the Prophet had, according to his Commiſſion, openly declared their intended ruine; and, by limiting it to a time, proclaimed, from that power above the Clouds, that at the end of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, their City and the inhabitants ſhould be deſtroyed: when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this, and proclaimed a Faſt, and humbled themſelves, by giving publick teſtimony of their ſorrow, and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of amendment, (<hi>Jonah</hi> 3.6.) God ſaw their works, that their reſolutions were, not only ſighing and ſnivling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; but that they were turned from their evil wayes; and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and did it not. But, for a full and final reſolution; ſince prayer is made to Almighty God, not only, in order to receive what we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for; but alſo to teſtifie our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on, and ſubjection to, that being to whom we pray: If wicked men did not accompliſh the former end, yet it is moſt certain, that they may gain the latter; and even this will ſufficiently prove the lawfulneſs of wicked mens prayers. But this is not all: For, 'tis plainly evident, that God does grant the petitions of wicked
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36404:72"/>men, when, under Chriſtianity, they have fallen into ſome habits of ſin, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm, that did at firſt regenerate them; particularly, as to many things that concern this life, and are the fruits of his general providence; and by this he proclaims his goodneſs to the world. <hi>For he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and the good;</hi> and ſendeth rain, as well to refreſh the ſinners land, as the inheritance of the Saints, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45.) And even this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration does not only reſtrain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and violence of ſuch kind of men, and cauſe them to moderate their vices. But, it obliges the better natured and more ingenuous perſons among them, frequently to forſake their ſins, and to grow more towardly, by Gods granting their requeſts in ſuch things as theſe. The great God is ſo gracious, that he has a general love to mankind, and is good to them as they are the workmanſhip of his own hands: he hates nothing that he ever made, but when it alters and diſcompoſes its own being. Nay, in relation to the univerſal race of men, <hi>He would that all theſe ſhould he ſaved, and come to the practical knowledge of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36404:72"/>the truth,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4,). And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when a wicked man prayes from a powerful and ſtrong natural deſire, God will hear his petition as far as it is good, and his prayers aim at juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Otherwiſe, we have all (at leaſt, I muſt confeſs for my ſelf) ſuch an unhappy mixture of evil and good, that all our prayers may juſtly be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of a good ſucceſs. Nay, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that the Grace of Almighty God muſt concurr with the deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of men, <hi>to turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> (which, ſurely, none among us will deny): How ſhould men be converted from the error of their ways, if they have no hope of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſucceſs, <hi>Turn us, O good Lord, and ſo ſhall we be turned?</hi> I know there are ſome Texts in Sacred Writ, that may deterr wicked men from praying; nay, ſometimes others alſo, whoſe thoughts, being the reſult of falſe principles, or melancholy and untow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard humours, poſſeſs themſelves with the conceipt, that they are ſtill in an unregenerate ſtate; when, by ſhaking off the one, and curing the other, the day clears up upon them, and they find
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36404:73"/>they were only under a miſtake. Such a Text is that of the blind man, miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to whom our Saviour reſtored his ſight, (John 9.31.) <hi>We know that God heareth not ſinners:</hi> And that of <hi>Solomon, The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> (Prov. 15.8.) and others of the like ſound. That I may therefore preſerve ſuch Texts ſacred, and give a juſt ſtare of this thing; It muſt be (as it is frequently) obſerved, that there are ſins of infirmity, or ſuch as are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with wilfulneſs and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Sins of infirmity, I call thoſe, which eſcape from us by a ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption, when we happen to be inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or to be drawn aſide through the violence of moſt powerful tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when we uſe, what we can, the means to ſuppreſs them, abating ſtill for the common frailties and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men. And theſe, if we do not afterwards allow them, or think upon the commiſſion with ſome delight, but diſclaim and hate them, if we repent of the acts, and are more cautious and vigilant for the time to come, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated by the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and ſhall not hinder the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our prayers, But then there
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:36404:73"/>are, alſo, ſuch ſins, as, by frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, are improved into habits, which we act wilfully with delight and pleaſure; and theſe denominate men wicked, ſet them at open enmity with God, and are acts of publick ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility againſt him. Men that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe things, <hi>walk in the counſel of the ungodly;</hi> ſin with purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and ſo <hi>ſtand in the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> as the expreſſion is, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1.) And this is ſuch a ſtate of life, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt with a ſtate of Grace, for that time in which it is perſiſted in; nor can there be a recovery from the danger to which ſuch a courſe expoſes men, till they are very ſorrowful for their paſt commiſſions, and actually forſake them for the time to come; and, having hope and faith, through the blood of Chriſt to obtain their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they practiſe the vertues oppoſite to theſe vices. And of ſuch an habitual ſtate of ſin the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>We know that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not,</hi> (1 John 5.18.) And by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, he ſuppoſes the children of God, to be manifeſted from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.) Nay, this wretched ſtate is what uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36404:74"/>denominates men ſinners in the Scripture. Now, he that thus <hi>turneth away his ear from hearing Gods Law; i. e.</hi> does not obey it; 'tis no wonder, that <hi>his prayer is an abomination,</hi> (Prov. 28.9.). And how can any man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect, that God ſhould ſo hear his prayers, as to grant ſupplies to his neceſſities, when, as an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to him, and an open declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Heaven, he thus confidently makes his addreſſes? When we wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject Gods deſires to us, how can we expect any thing leſs, than that he ſhould deny thoſe requeſts we make to him? But whatever obſervations ſome men may make, for ends, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, not very good, where God may ſeem to grant the petitions of wicked men, either as a method (which they are ignorant of) to heap his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their heads, or as means to accompliſh the deſigns of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or in ſuch things as tend to the ſupport of humane nature, as they are men living in this world. Yet they cannot expect a gracious anſwer; or if they do, 'tis to no purpoſe, becauſe vengeance will be mixed with the things he beſtows: If (1.) They pray
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36404:74"/>
                  <hi>ex deſiderio peccati,</hi> (as Schoolmen phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it); or as the Apoſtle, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſume what they receive upon the ſatisfaction of their luſts: For then they ask and receive not, becauſe they ask amiſs. And in ſuch a ſenſe, the ſacrifice of the wicked muſt, be abomination; and whatever they do, in order to ſuch an end, is ſin. (2.) When wicked men pray without a previous and due humiliation of their minds, for thoſe crimes which they are guilty of, and ſtand convicted for, in their own conſciences, and at the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God; or without ſuch a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to relinquiſh their ſins as ſhall be brought to perfect effect in the proceſs of their lives: when they do not ſmite on their breaſts with the Publican; but either conceal their ſins, as <hi>David</hi> did, ſometime, his adultery and murder; or juſtifie them with the Phariſees, and call evil good. <hi>For he that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall find mercy.</hi> (Pro. 28.13.) To pray to God with a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to cheriſh thoſe ſins, which he ſo much hates, is to affront him to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry face; to ſpread our defiled garments before him, as if they were pure and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36404:75"/>clean; or his eyes could now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity. This is like an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Traitor, when he comes to ask preferment of a King; when he ſhould beg pardon, with an halter about his neck To be like <hi>Judas,</hi> who betrayed our Saviour with a kiſs; and boldly to conclude that the innocence of our faces muſt incline God to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with our ſins. This is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the ſight of honeſt men, much more muſt it be odious in the ſight of God; unleſs, as ſome men ſtrangly preſume, it may be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he will overlook our crimes, as he is pleaſed to paſs by our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Of this impenitent ſtate may we underſtand that of <hi>David</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18.) If I regard iniquity in mine heart, the Lord will not hear me; and the prayers of ſuch men are an abomination. Nay, God himſelf, who can neither ly, nor equivocate, ſays of ſuch men, that they offer the multitude of their ſacrifices to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> if they preſent them with an expectation of ſuch an acceptance, as that the ſupream Being ſhould be appeaſed by them. And in this ſence is it, that he expoſtulates with the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36404:75"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> and forbids them to bring any more vain oblations, till they had waſhed and made themſelves clean, and put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes; till they had ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do evil, and learned to do well. Otherwiſe (ſays he) incenſe is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination; the new Moons and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the calling of aſſemblies, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with; It is iniquity, even the ſolemn meeting: <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear, your hands are full of blood.</hi> (Iſaiah 1.) (3.) Wicked men muſt not expect Gods favourable anſwer when they pray for ſuch things, the conceſſion of which may give too great and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect occaſion for others to conclude, that God gives countenance to ſin; whether it be lodged in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the will, or in both. As for example; That ſuch men may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to work miracles, in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their errors, or to ſupport their ſinful and Diabolical deſigns. And therefore we find that when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have purchaſed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of conferring the Holy Ghoſt upon his own Diſciples; becauſe this would
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36404:76"/>have confirmed his deviliſh doctrines amongſt the people, and that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred gift and authority was too pure for his impious and defiled hands: S. <hi>Peter</hi> made a reply to him, as ſharp and ſevere, as it was quick and ſudden: <hi>Thy money periſh with thee, thou haſt neither lot nor part in this matter; for thine heart is not right in the ſight of God,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.20, 21.). And this was the reaſon alſo of the ſaying of him that was born blind, <hi>John</hi> 9.31.) <hi>Now, we know, that God heareth not ſinners.</hi> For we find the Jews, (<hi>ver.</hi> 24.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the man to give God the glory of his cure; but none to our Saviour, by whoſe authority he was made whole, who had not ſight reſtored, but given to him: <hi>For we know,</hi> ſay they, (meaning Chriſt) <hi>that this man is a ſinner,</hi> and therefore could have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to work ſuch a Miracle. To which the enlightened perſon replies thus, to confute their calumny, and at the ſame time to prove the authority of the Miracle, That he hath opened mine eyes is apparent; <hi>Now we know that God heareth not ſinners.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, God would not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the petition of any that were a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36404:76"/>ſinner and impoſtor, as you ſuppoſe him to be, who has opened mine eyes, and given ſight to me, to cauſe ſo great a Miracle to be done by him; becauſe, ſuch a thing would harden him in his vice, and confirm his impoſture: And therefore, ſince God hears none, in ſuch a caſe as this, but one that is a true worſhipper of him, and does his will; it follows, <hi>that you are miſtaken in your thoughts of him: For if this man were not of God, he could have done nothing of this nature; nor gained ſuch a power from above, as to have been able to open mine eyes, who was born blind.</hi> But now, though God hears not the prayers of wicked men when they petition him in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned circumſtances, or with a deſign to obtain the power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles: yet the caſe will be quite altered, when with a deep ſenſe of their ſins, and great humility of ſoul, they make their approaches with confeſſion in their mouths, and a real reſolution to forſake thoſe ſins that have hitherto ſeparated betwixt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and themſelves: God is willing, then, to hearken to them; to adopt them into his family; to make them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36404:77"/>the objects of his care, and more eſpecial providence; and to cauſe joy in Heaven for the ſinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. He calls to them, then, as he did to the Jews; <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together; Although your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll,</hi> (Iſa. 1.18.) God che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the firſt beginnings of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he will neither <hi>break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax:</hi> But he encourageth the firſt motions to a return, accepts our ſincerity, and quickens and crowns our faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: And when, wicked men, in ſuch circumſtances of hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, addreſs themſelves to a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, they will loſe, by degrees, their former denomination; and quickly <hi>have an Advocate with the Father, who is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> And having an intereſt in ſuch a High Prieſt, who is the Biſhop of the ſouls of men, they may <hi>come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that they may obtain mercy, and find grace to help them in time of need,</hi> (Heb. 4.16.). When any men come to God with that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of mind, in which the <hi>Centurion</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:36404:77"/>clothed, and addreſſed, himſelf to our Saviour, (Matth. 8.8.) <hi>Lord! I am unworthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof:</hi> they may then, whatever they have been before, piouſly expect, that, according to the reality of their faith, and the ſincerity of their minds, it ſhall be done unto them. The Thief, upon the Croſs, had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom;</hi> but Chriſt, knowing the intention of his mind, which he now diſcovered, not only by his prayer, but alſo by the rebuke of his aſſociate, preſently replyed, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 23.42, 43.) And why ſhould any perſon fear, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good deſigns, and hearty inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to amend his life, in addreſſing himſelf to ſuch a God, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions are infinite? When <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> her ſelf was admitted to his favour, out of whom went ſeven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and to whom alſo much was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given: Nay, let Gods promiſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, become our encouragement; by no means for a continuance in our ſins; (for Grace will not abound then:) but to admoniſh us to repent and pray. Eſpecially, ſince he has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36404:78"/>not only, that he <hi>keeps mercy for thouſands:</hi> But more particularly, that <hi>when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive,</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27.). Could any man be more vile than <hi>Saul,</hi> who perſecuted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity even to the death, and was now ſtruck blind with his Commiſſion about him (which was an infallible teſtimony of his guilt, and an evidence beyond oral witneſs) to bring all the Chriſtians, he could find, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> having firſt bound them, that they might receive their ſentence? And yet, through the infinite mercy of God our Saviour, <hi>Ananias</hi> was ſent miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to recover him, when once he humbled himſelf and prayed: <hi>Enquire for Saul</hi> (ſayes our Lord in a Viſion) <hi>for, behold he prayeth,</hi> (<hi>Acts.</hi> 9.11.). Certainly, therefore, none is ſo vile, but, if he has ſo real a reſolution of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, that want of time only, in this mortal life, can hinder it from appearing in ſincere action, he may addreſs himſelf to Almighty God, and ſhall find grace to aſſiſt him in time of need.</p>

               <p>THe laſt enquiry which I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be made in relation to this great duty of prayer, is, to conſider, whether it is neceſſary or no. And this would need no diſcourſe at all, would men be contented with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the Goſpel, and not mix Chriſtianity with Philoſophical diſputes, and turn all publick places of meeting, into Schools of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, where every man determines out of the Chair, that was never in it. Chriſtian Religion would be much more eaſie than it is, if men would look upon it as matter of fact, a thing that was once done and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the great Meſſiah, who was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to proclaim Gods Covenant of Grace to the world, ſealed by the blood of the Mediator, and all conveyed down to us, in the way which is now recommended and practiſed in ſuch
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:36404:79"/>Churches, as own the Scriptures to be their Rule of faith and manners, and impoſe nothing in the Circumſtances and Ceremonies that attend Religion, but what is decent, in order, and for edification, and no where prohibited in the Word of God; no, nor yet the contrary enjoyned and commanded; and therefore ſuch cannot be ſinful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, unleſs men, pretending to Chriſtianity, can find a tranſgreſſion where there is no Law. But however, becauſe it has been a faſhion, (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of deſign) to render eaſie things, by ſome mens perplexing them for their own advantage, difficult and hard: That I may not ſeem willing to avoid trouble; and becauſe no other more neceſſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a Miniſter is conſidered, than what is made publick by preaching, or writing, I am reſolved at this time, being in a complying humour, neither to balk the queſtions of Knaves, nor the ſcruples of Fools. The ſtrong foundation upon which this enquiry is built, is upon the notion of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; and, in purſuance of theſe, his Providence over the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what neceſſity is there of prayer, ſince it cannot alter Gods Decrees, and,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36404:79"/>in conſequence of it, the actions of his Providence? But is it not ſtrange, that ſome men ſhould raiſe doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which nature it ſelf has ſeem'd to dictate, and is one of the principles of mankind? What if we meet with ſome few Sceptical Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who love to hear themſelves talk; and becauſe their ſpirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to their tongues, and too well love their lodging there, having left few in their brains to direct and guide them, are mightily pleaſed with their volubility of language, and the venting their paſſions, without any dictates from the concluſions of their retired minds, but make their affections Clowns to their underſtandings, whilſt they paſs by without any ceremony or conſideration? Yet I am reſolved to prove prayer to be neceſſary, in ſpight of all Atheiſts and Fanaticks, if they will attend to reaſon, or but conſult their own ſyſtems. He that denyes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, let him ſhew the reaſon of the common and periodical revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of things; or how he himſelf came into the world; and the original of thoſe powers by which he manages ſuch an argument. And if he cannot
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36404:80"/>deny that God is, the whole world will hiſs at him, if he will not grant, that he ought to be invoked, and prayed to. And as for thoſe, who allow prayer in the practice, but yet, deſtroy the reaſon of it, by their principles, and grow diſtracted by their belief in God, loſing his Attributes, whilſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Name; I muſt principally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſuch men under this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. And, that I may obtain leave with others in the world, that make ſome figure among mankind, to beat the buſh before any thing is ſtarted; give me leave to acquaint you, that 'tis a common diviſion of that worſhip which we owe to God, into a Moral, and Ceremonial, part. Moral, is that, by which we pay our duty to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Moral Precepts and Commands implanted in our natures, or otherwiſe ſufficiently revealed, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his will in his daily provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Ceremonial, is a due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of thoſe Rites and circumſtances that juſtly tend to the promotion of the Moral parts of worſhip. Now, though this latter be the controverſie of our Countrey, and thoſe times in which we live; though debates and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36404:80"/>objections concerning this, are the ſparks, that ſet whole houſes on fire, lay Cities waſte, and make their Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants prey upon each other; and like thorns, crackle under the Pots of ſome, who would be accounted little leſs than Prophets, when having laid, they foretell, their own deſigns, and by lucky hits bring them to paſs. Yet, ſince the firſt is not without its difficulties, ſuitable to the variation of the fancies, judgements, or intereſt of men; who, according to their pleaſure, or the admiration of others, make things either hard or ſoft, difficult or eaſie, when it is their will to obſcure or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them. Before I proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the particular ſubject under conſideration, it may not be amiſs, to be inſtructed in its preparatives, and general ingredients, as it is a part of Moral Worſhip, in which is included that which is Natural. To compleat which, there muſt (1.) Be a ſerious conſideration of the works of God, which ſufficiently declare his Being to the world. (2.) A right judgement upon, and collection from, them. (3.) A rational and ſuitable affection of mind, proportionable to our reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36404:81"/>inferences, and deductions. And, Laſtly, a conſtant demonſtration of this affection throughout the whole courſe of our lives; eſpecially in our confeſſions, prayers and thankſgivings to God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then do we juſtly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the works of God, when we make diligent ſearch into them, and fix our minds upon the excellency of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and orderly diſpoſal for uſe and ornament. When we conſider both the Heavens and the Earth; and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly reflect upon our ſelves, (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did), and ſee how fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully we are made; that from hence we may infer the wiſdom, goodneſs, and power of God. (2.) Then do we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the next thing preparative to prayer, and adoration, when, upon the intellectual view of any of Gods works of Creation, or Providence, we own and acknowledge his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes thus rendred apparent to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſufficient footſteps of theſe in the works of his hands. <hi>Thus the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work: Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge,</hi> (Pſal.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:36404:81"/>19.1, 2.) And the inviſible things of him (ſayes St. <hi>Paul</hi>) are clearly ſeen from the Creation of the World, being underſtood by <hi>the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> (Rom. 1.20. (3.) We aſcend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtep of moral ſervice, when, by due conſideration, we act with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and judgment upon the works of God; inferring from thence his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes; and, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and view, we are properly and truly affected with them, as things that mark out a moſt excellent Being. This affection will appear in our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, love, and awful regard to him; in our humility of mind, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him; in our rejoycing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in him; and the like acts of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures, towards their great and Soveraign Creator. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (Laſtly,) we muſt give all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony of theſe affections throughout the whole courſe of our lives, by adoring him whom we have cauſe to fear; by invoking him on whom we depend; by giving thanks to him who is our great Benefactor; by continual calling on his power for aid, and praying his goodneſs to relieve us
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36404:82"/>in our neceſſities; and by a conſtant obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him who is our King, and moſt Supreme Governour. Now though none, almoſt, who is endowed with any reaſon and underſtanding, can refuſe, from the proſpect of this, to conclude prayer to be both neceſſary and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous; Yet the Diſputers of this World, eſpecially when they like not the man that writes it, will not be ſo eaſily ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For, (1.) Some have conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red things to come to paſs by chance and fortune, denying Gods Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World by Providence. (2.) Others have introduced a Stoical fatality, concluding all things to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, baniſhing what we call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency. Now whether this is ſaid to come to paſs by the concatenation of ſecond Cauſes, by the fatality of Stars, or by reaſon of abſolute and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Decrees; This Principle, like the former, takes away the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of prayer, as it regards the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring benefits to our ſelves; and renders our petitions uſeleſs, and in vain, if God be inexorable, and has ſo tied himſelf up by his own Decrees, that he will not be intreated by the moſt profound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere devotions, nor the moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36404:82"/>humble and hearty prayers of men, whom he has yet commanded to petition him. Oh! What a ſtrange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do ſome men make him? This ſuppoſes him to be ſo unlike to the great Maker and Governor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that a man, of but a tolerable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ingenuity, would be aſhamed of ſuch a deſcription of himſelf. Now though it might be a ſufficient anſwer to Objections raiſed from ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous principles, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the propoſitions upon which ſuch inferences are built. Yet, becauſe it would too much ſwell this Diſcourſe; I ſhall rather do it, with reference unto prayer, by this more ſhort and ready Method. (1.) By ſhewing that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his dark, and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, Decrees, God has promiſed to hear and grant mens lawful petitions. (2.) That he has done ſo even when he had ſeemed to determine things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to what they asked. And (3.) by giving ſome reaſons for this Duty of prayer, which will determine the point, how great ſoever the Objections againſt it may appear to be.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God has promiſed to hear and grant mens lawful petitions. <hi>Offer to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:36404:83"/>God thankſgiving, and pay thy vows unto the moſt high; And call upon me</hi> (ſays God) <hi>in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> (Pſal. 50.14, 15.). When <hi>Solomon</hi> had finiſhed that glorious Temple, devoutly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the honour of God; the great Jehovah ſignified to him the acceptance both of his prayer, and dedication, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the wiſe choice of that place for an houſe of Sacrifice; And then he makes this ſolemn promiſe; <hi>If I ſhut up heaven that there be no rain; or if I command the locuſts to devour the land; or if I ſend a peſtilence among my people: If my people, upon whom my name is called, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways; Then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their ſin, and will heal their land: And mine eyes ſhall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place,</hi> (2 Chron. 7th Chap. 13, 14, 15.). And if any one ſhould unreaſonably think that ſuch promiſes only concerned the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the thing, which it is quoted to prove, is equally, as to the main ſubſtance, a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and an incouragement to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; let him quit the Old Teſtament
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:36404:83"/>in point of Controverſie; and we will preſently make uſe only of the New. But then ſome Jeſuited Proteſtants might many times loſe their Cauſe, if they had not Prophecies to retire to in the dark; and would have nothing but the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> to guide them. Yet however, let us peruſe the New Teſtament; and the promiſes, in this caſe, will appear more large and comprehenſive; <hi>where we have the blood of Sprinkling, ſpeaking better things than the blood of Abel;</hi> that pleads ſtrongly for the acceptance of Chriſtians lawful petitions; <hi>where we have the Mediator of a better Covenant, who continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the preſence of God, preſenting both his ſufferings and his triumphs, and, in virtue of his Sacrifice upon the Croſs, now liveth to make interceſſion for us;</hi> and therefore our prayers, through his hands aſcend as incenſe, when we offer our Spiritual Sacrifices by him, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor does ſufficiently conſecrate them, <hi>in whoſe name we are exhorted to come boldly to the Throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help us in time of need,</hi> (Heb. 4.16.) Nay, our bleſſed Saviour himſelf incourages all his Diſciple to make their petitions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36404:84"/>to Almighty God. <hi>Ask</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened,</hi> (Matth. 7.7, 8.) Furthermore, he confirms this by the addition of a promiſe to uſe his utmoſt intereſt in it, and his Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority to beſtow what we law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pray for; And certainly, in this ſtate of Chriſtianity, we may fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his Interceſſion and ability; <hi>Becauſe all power is given to him, both in heaven and in earth.</hi> See therefore what he ingages for, (<hi>John</hi> 14.13, 14.). <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do;</hi> and doubles the promiſe for the greater aſſurance to his Diſciples: Nay, not only ſo, but repeats it with a double aſſeveration; <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name, he will give it you,</hi> (Joh. 16.23, 24, and 27.). Our Saviour was ſo careful to prevent, or ſcatter, all thoſe fears that, like a Cloud, hung over his Diſciples heads, upon the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they might have of his departure from them, that he does not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſend the Comforter to them,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36404:84"/>but aſſures them, upon the word of truth, that when in any ſtraits and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of affairs, they ſhould, through him, make their addreſſes unto God, they ſhould have ready audience, and a quick return made to their prayers. <hi>And therefore he bids them ask and they ſhall receive, that their joy might be full;</hi> and gives a ſufficient argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to petition, and embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens their faith and hope in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; becauſe the Father himſelf has a great kindneſs for all thoſe who evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence their affection to the Son of his boſom, and the delight of his ſoul. <hi>So that ſooner ſhall the earth be diſſolved, and the heavens melt,</hi> than ſuch promiſes, ſo powerfully confirmed, fail of their accompliſhment; nor can any man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſtruſt them, when he is himſelf, that concludes God to be faithful, and immutable, and does not think our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt to be the greateſt Impoſtor in the World. (2.) God has heard mens prayers for ſuch things as they have asked, even when he had ſeemed to have determined beforehand what was contrary to the end of their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore, although he knows our wants before we utter and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:36404:85"/>make them publick by open addreſſes; yet as his command for prayer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of audience takes off that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So if his determinations have, <hi>de facto,</hi> been altered upon mens devout prayers, and humble ſupplications, it doth not only prove ſome Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; but ſufficiently baffles all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to prayer which we may receive from any uncouth and abſurd Doctrines of men concerning abſolute and irreſpective determinations, with reference to the beings here on Earth; which, in their conſequence, render prayers uſeleſs, and juſtifie what they call perſecution; ſince, in my opinion, they ſhould follow, or at leaſt ſubmit to, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, (if they ſtate it right) as well in, what the vulgar call, misfortunes, as they pretended to do, in their glories, and in their triumphs. But, though Gods Providence is over all his works, and like a wiſe Governour, he ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the World: Yet ſince ſecret things belong unto him, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, and to our children; His apparent commands are to be the rules for our practice, and not his obſcure and hidden Decrees; which myſtical, and pretending, perſons, who confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36404:85"/>aſſume the monopoly of Dreams, would fain have authority to ſoothſay upon; that they may not appear to be ignorant in that which no man can know; and yet theſe would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it might be propitious to their deſigns, reſolve all their villany into them. But what a ſtrange confuſion would be introduced into the World (although ſincerity did attend opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) if Subjects ſhould proportion their actions of life according to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conjectures they have of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and deſigns of their Prince, and not guide themſelves by his known Laws? The Laws would, then, no longer be his, but their own; and upon an uncertain, though frightful, previſion, they would rebel either by nature or inſtinct, and wipe their mouths whilſt they gravely make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence their Leader. Such would our deportment be towards God, ſhould we meaſure our Duties by Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which we could never know: and leave his written Laws mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in his word, by which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his will to men. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men who make Providence to be their conductor in theſe affairs; though
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36404:86"/>they have been in earneſt, yet, now, are but in jeſt with us; ſince it ſeems but to ſerve their turn at ſuch a time, in which they ſay they groan under, and cry out on, perſecution from thoſe, who, having gained the whip hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it very gently upon them; nor would I have it (were it in my power) too ſevere upon the backs of any; nor any ways intolerable on the Maſters of Aſſemblies. And truly, I know not but it might be born with a little patience, though they ſhould be compell'd to take Country air to preſerve their own health, when they make others ſick in the Town by ſtaying. But however it fares with particular contrivers, that follow Providence, whilſt it comports with their own intereſt; yet certainly, whatever may be the myſtical concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any Enthuſiaſtical men, whoſe fancy may blow them up to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, and, for ought ſome others know, to the very ſenſe of an Inſpiration; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which was always dark and full of riddles, was never deſigned as a Rule to mens lives; becauſe from this are frequently deduced oppoſite, and quite contrary concluſions. Alas! men (who, when blown up like a bladder,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36404:86"/>are no more, though when broken they may make a louder crack) cannot ſee through the Clouds of Heaven, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the Council of the adorable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor read the Decrees, or Records above, that accordingly they may act here on Earth. Mortal men in this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable ſtate below, are to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>to the Law, and to the Teſtimony;</hi> and if any ſpeak not according to this word, (whatever illuminations they may pretend) <hi>it is becauſe there is no light within them,</hi> (Iſai. 8.20.) And, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no cauſe to doubt (if our Maker be a God of truth, and deſigned not to impoſe upon the World) but that I may affirm, without any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous oppoſition, that his ſecret will does not contradict his revealed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the boldneſs and impiety of the diſtinction, as it is made uſe of in Gods dealing with men: or as the Symbol and infallible teſt of one party renouncing all Symbolical Ceremonies. Having thus too largely prefaced that which I promiſed to prove: (which I ſtrived to check my Pen in; but my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding would dictate to my will, and both muſt unavoidably guide my hand). I come now to give ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36404:87"/>where prayer has prevailed with God to grant petitions, when yet he had ſeemed to have determined things contrary to the ſence of them. And I ſhall not fetch too large a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, but name a few. The firſt ſhall be the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> when, in the abſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their expectation, they had cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a molten Calf to be made, and had offered burnt, and peace-offerings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and devoted this prophane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of theirs by a ſolemn Feſtival; God was ſo imaged at this abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he did not only abhor the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>but declared in wrath, that they had corrupted themſelves, and that they were a ſtiff-necked people:</hi> Nay, he forbad <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to intercede for them, that he might render them as great an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his fury, as he had before of his mercy, and his Miracles. <hi>Now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let me alone</hi> (ſaies God to <hi>Moſes,</hi>) <hi>that my wrath may wax hot againſt them and that I may conſume them:</hi> And yet, upon the interceſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the text declares, <hi>that the Lord repented him of the evil which he thought to do unto his people,</hi> (Exod. 32.14.). Again, when they were diſcontented, and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:36404:87"/>at the report made to them of the Promiſed Land, and, for theſe ſignals of their diſobedience, the great God threatened to <hi>ſmite them with the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and to diſinherit them of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and Land together, which he had before given them a title to; Yet, upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s interceſſion and prayer, in their behalf, when he beſeeched God <hi>to pardon the iniquity of the people, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greatneſs of his mercy;</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him this gracious anſwer; <hi>I have pardoned according to thy word,</hi> (Numb. 14.20.). And, indeed, to give thoſe frequent inſtances of this people, obtaining mercy by prayer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when God had declared his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to puniſh, would be to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them from their Cradle to their Grave: for as he loved <hi>Iſrael</hi> when it was a child, ſo his affection continued as they grew up, and his mercy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to their old age: And though their ſinful obſtinacy, when there was no hope of recovery left, after various methods in which their ſafety was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, cauſed God to abate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by degrees; Yet, it was not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally withdrawn, till he was forced <hi>to lay his ax to the root of the tree, and to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:36404:88"/>cut it down for cumbring the ground;</hi> to cauſe a calamitous diſperſion of them, and put a final period to their State and Government. So that to inſtance in all their deliverances, and frequent preſervations obtained by prayer, would be to write an Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to tranſcribe, almoſt, all their Annals. They ſin'd, very often, in the midſt of Miracles; and, yet, upon their repentance and prayer, the grace of God as often pardoned them; and he revok'd his Sentence, even when it was paſs'd, and gone forth againſt them. So that this people was not a greater and more laſting Monument of his vaſt and incomprehenſible Power, than they were examples of his forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and long ſuffering; being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered objects of his infinite mercy, and as large an inſtance of the prevalency of prayer, as they were of his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and compaſſion. But, a ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and proof too, of Gods being prevailed upon by prayer, to revoke a Sentence when it was decreed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, ſhall be an inſtance in <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> (2 Kings, 20th Chap.). When this King was ſick, and God had ſent the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to him, to declare that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:36404:88"/>ſtartling and fatal Sentence; <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live.</hi> He preſently turned himſelf to the wall, and mixing tears with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate prayer, beſeeched God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Decree, and reſcind his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: And ſuch was the prevalence of his ſincere deſire, that his petitions were not only heard, but anſwered too; his tears, being not thoſe of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Crocodile weeping over a prey which he intended to devour, were quickly wiped off from his cheeks; and a grant from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beyond any reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, exchanged his mourning for joy and gladneſs, <hi>and added fifteen years to his life;</hi> and, in order to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them, he was directed, from above, to the uſe of thoſe things here below, that might infallibly, when God himſelf was pleaſed to aſſiſt, be the means of his Cure. And, to comfort him in the interval, he gave him a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous ſign of the accompliſhment, that he might have ſome preſent eaſe and ſatisfaction. The laſt inſtance, to prove this point, which now has fallen under conſideration, ſhall be that of <hi>Nin ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> For when God had pronounced
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36404:89"/>his Sentence againſt that people, and commanded <hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it; which denunciation was very preciſe; <hi>That at the end of forty daies, Niniveh ſhould be deſtroyed:</hi> Yet, as ſoon as there was a Faſt proclaimed, and the Citizens had clothed themſelves with Sackcloth as a publick teſtimony, and ſignificant ceremony of their guilt and ſorrow, and reſolution of amendment, and cried mightily unto God in prayer, attended by a ſolemn repentance: The Text declares, <hi>that he ſaw their works, and repented of the evil which he ſaid he would do unto them, and did it not,</hi> (Jonah 3.10.) And till theſe, and ſuch like, examples are blotted out of the Sacred Records, we have no reaſon to forbear our prayers upon any notion of Gods Decrees, or from any Sceptical or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe concluſions which any of the high ſlown wits of men may draw from an unalterable Providence; the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paths of which are paſt our finding out; becauſe, being not ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us, they are, like the ſecrets of Princes, kept privately, (without which, confuſion would preſently mix with their Government) and lock'd up in a cloſe Cabinet; and therefore we
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36404:89"/>cannot draw concluſions when we are ignorant of the premiſſes, from whence our inferences ſhould be made. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence will certainly be too obſcure, (unleſs that which is ſteady and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, uniform, and, in all revolutions, ſtill the ſame) for us to draw certain and infallible rules from, to conduct us in the duties and affairs of this life. And yet we may, and ought too, after the acts of Providence are rendred viſible, to make ſome reflections, as it relates to our ſelves; though we ought to be extremely cautious how we paſs Cenſures upon others, from the conſideration of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards them; becauſe if we are too bold in that, we do not only give too great an evidence of a very partial and ill nature; but we ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten acquit the guilty, whilſt we paſs Sentence upon the innocent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the generation of Gods children. It may be lawful, in the general, to read our ſins by our own particular temporal puniſhments; nay, the kind of ſin we have been guilty of, which has provoked God to be ſevere againſt us, when the ſin is manifeſt in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which is the conſequent of it.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:36404:90"/>But this cannot be managed by every man; Becauſe it requires a large obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; great and deep thoughtfulneſs of heart, attended with very much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prudence. Yet, when any diſmal, or adverſe, affliction happens to betide us, we cannot offend: But we muſt be induſtrious, in ſearching out our waies, and turning to the Lord our God; and it ought to cauſe ſome humiliation in our own minds, though, all this while, the Providence of God may wiſely deſign it for our advantage. But nothing of this nature can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably give a check to our devotion; or be an argument againſt invoking the Deity. Eſpecially, if (in the laſt place) we conſider, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all Objections, there are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſons to determine us in this point, and fix prayer as a duty upon us. For (1.), Admitting, that all things were predetermined by their Creator, not only in the general, but in particular too; in what order they ſhould be in the world; what regard they ſhould bear to each other; nay, the minuteſt circumſtances of perſons, and things: Yet ſince all muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by a wiſe and powerful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:36404:90"/>of actives, to paſſives; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorating Cauſes, to produce their effects, or, withdrawing their force; Or, by new mixtures, altering their nature, as may beſt comport with the particular ends of the Eternal Decree: Since it is moſt certain that means are uſed, by the Supreme Governour, to bring about the deſigns of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; who knows, but prayer may be one? Eſpecially, ſince it infallibly operates upon the minds of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any rhetorical exhortation in the world, to cauſe them to change evil reſolutions, and to ſubmit to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the moſt wiſe Being; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it could not incline him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any Decree that is gone out of his mouth, nor break any link in the fixed, and determined, chain of Providence. Nay, we may with great reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be ſo; when, (2.) We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that we are commanded to pray by God himſelf, whoſe infinite wiſdom never deſigned ſuch great ſolemnity to no purpoſe; nor can he only appoint it in honour to himſelf, when he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it ſhall be beneficial unto us: How can we otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand St. <hi>James</hi> (Chap. 5.13.)? <hi>Is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:36404:91"/>any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any man ſick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him: and the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> had petitioned to no purpoſe, when Sathan ſtir'd up ſome potent luſt, in his own fleſh, or the malice of his ſevere adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to buffet him, if prayer had not been a means to convey relief to him; and yet we find him thrice interceding, in his own behalf, for the removal of this afflicting evil, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.). And, though he might not obtain the particular thing which he prayed for; yet inſtead of that, he gained grace, and ſtrength, to ſupport him in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and, in the end, to triumph over his infirmities, and ſnares. But what matter is it, how great and formidable Objections are, by which carnal and indevout men quarrel, that which they find to be a duty inconſiſtent with their looſe and ungodly temper? As long as we find the generality of mankind, to have endeavoured, from a natural inſtinct, to appeaſe the Deity, and render God propitious to them: As long as any outward Revelation has been legible to the World, we find
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:36404:91"/>prayer an ingredient in mens worſhip: It was the practice both of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> commanded both by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> What ſhould we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard fallacious and ill-grounded argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for, againſt ſo ſolemn and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a duty? When our Saviour himſelf has taught us to pray, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that we ſhall receive what we ask for, if we ask not amiſs: when we read thoſe precepts of the inſpired, and bleſſed, Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul; Pray without ceaſing; continue inſtant in prayer,</hi> and the like; when we know that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Primitive Chriſtians, were conſtant and zealous in their prayers; and from them it has been derived downwards, as a duty to us, through all the intermediate Ages of the Church. Nay, unleſs, Finally, we could prove that Sacred Text to be <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.); <hi>In every thing, by prayer, and ſupplication, with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> And, who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, if it were in his power, cancel ſuch a duty, which, beſides the inward ſatisfaction men converſant in it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the performance, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly and orderly acted towards God,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:36404:92"/>through the merits of our Saviour, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal bleſſings? <hi>Elijah</hi> prayed for rain in a time of drought, and the Heavens, quickly relenting, wept. (1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 18th Chap.). <hi>Hannah</hi> petitioned God for a Son, and then brought forth <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. For this child</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>I prayed, and the Lord gave me my petition that I asked of him,</hi> (1 Sam. 1.27.). <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im bemoaned himſelf,</hi> and prayed that he might be converted from the error of his ways; and God ſoon granted the requeſt: <hi>For I will ſurely have mercy on him, ſaith, the Lord,</hi> (Jer. 31.20.). So reaſonable is that exhortation of Saint <hi>James,</hi> (Chap. 1.5.); <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him. David</hi> at once acknowledged his ſin, and beg'd pardon; <hi>and God forgave him the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſin,</hi> (Pſal. 32.5.). And, therefore, he moſt juſtly infer'd a concluſion from it, to incourage others to this Sacred duty: <hi>For this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhall every one that is godly pray unto God, in a time when he may be found.</hi> Laſtly, we find the Thief upon the Croſs, by his ſhort pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, obtaining this anſwer; <hi>verily</hi> (ſays
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:36404:92"/>our Saviour) <hi>I declare to thee, that to day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> (Luke 23.48). So that ſuppoſing that there were no certainty, in this caſe, by which we might determine our duty, (as plainly there is): Yet when two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities appear, 'tis moſt rational to make our choice, in things where one muſt become our Option, according to the weight of Arguments, to incline us. And if this be a fair and equal ſtandard, we cannot poſſibly neglect, or recede from the duty of prayer; ſince the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it (if they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways be ſolved) are neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate for weight, or number, to the reaſons which have been urged for prayer. Eſpecially if, (3.) We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that in this we offer a reſignation of our ſelves, and all our concerns, to the God that made us; that prayer cauſes us to put a guard upon our ſelves, by our diſcovery of thoſe weakneſſes and breaches, which the enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or age in ſinning, or want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs by vertue and Religion, have made and enlarged upon us; and in this we alſo diſcern, as in a glaſs, the common infirmities of our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and how accidents in the world,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:36404:93"/>betray us into misfortunes; againſt all which we pray for aid, and petition for relief. And thus it becomes an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mean to cauſe us, <hi>to order our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright, that we may, at laſt, ſee the Salvation of God.</hi> Nay, ſome men (though I know not well upon what certain foundation) build the great uſe and advantage of prayer upon this thing: But by this they paſs it into an exhortation only, and ſeem as it were to tranſubſtantiate it; and abate not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the uſe of it, as diſtinguiſhed from all other duties, that convey knowledge, and raiſe affection; but from the advantages we receive by it. One obſerves this difference, betwixt Human and Divine Prayer: 'That prayer, among men, is ſuppoſed to be a mean to change the perſon to whom I we pray: But prayer to God does not change him; but only fits us for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things prayed for. Yet this cannot poſſibly be wholſom Doctrine, unleſs we allow it ſome grains of ſalt, by diſtinguiſhing betwixt Gods Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and his Will; his Eſſence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, cannot be changed by our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but his Will may. Again, before the former Aſſertion can be accounted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:36404:93"/>true, Gods Decrees muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into abſolute, and conditional; His, abſolute Decrees cannot be altered, but his conditional may, as I have proved before. However, we muſt conclude that one end of prayer, (and therefore one deſign of Gods commanding it, though this cannot be all) next to a profeſſion of our dependance on him, and that natural ſubjection we owe to him, ſeems to be, the influence it has upon our ſelves, to produce the growth and actions of piety and vertue, and the purifying our Souls, and Bodies too, for the reception of thoſe favours for which we make our humble petitions. And when we ſhall, with ſome thoughtfulneſs, conſider what a direct influence our prayers have, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing ſuch glorious deſigns; we cannot deny even this argument, to conclude our duty. For how effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do our prayers move us to thoſe vertues for the accompliſhment of which we implore Gods grace and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if we are at all hearty in our addreſſes? And how directly do they check thoſe vices which we both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a former, and pray againſt a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, commiſſion of? Our confeſſions
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:36404:94"/>bring our ſins to remembrance, and thoſe expreſſions by which we aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them with truth, cauſe us to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate thoſe miſcarriages which we thus, with horror, moſt dreadfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher. Our petitions mind us of our own infirmities, and the perſon from whom we obtain relief; and our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thankſgivings for bleſſings received impreſs our minds with a ſenſe of his goodneſs, and power, <hi>from whom comes every good and perfect gift.</hi> And the frequent repetitions of ſuch a duty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but inform us of our great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſo good a benefactor; fill our hearts with awe and reverence, and cauſe returns, in the obedience of our lives, to him, on whom we are made ſenſible of ſuch a large dependance, and from whom, as often as we ſay our prayers, we acknowledge to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed obligations. So that were this great and ſolemn duty of prayer, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſed, with due humility and intention of mind; it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for men to act thoſe ſins with induſtry and delight, which they do and muſt, confeſs with ſorrow, and beg the pardon of with ſeriouſneſs, and repentance. And I may, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:36404:94"/>give men aſſurance, that if they would more frequently pray, they would ſin leſs; and the rational and humble management of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to Almighty God would have great influence upon their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and actions, far beyond what thoſe can expect, by another method, who do not frequently, and ſeriouſly adventure the experiment. For as, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign good and welfare of the Soul, is the poſſeſſion of the likeneſs of God; when the mind, having the knowledge of him, is transformed into him: So by often admiring, and adoring his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, we earneſtly deſire that which we adore, and endeavour to reſemble what we admire; it being natural to rational men to imitate, in themſelves, that which they commend and praiſe in another. Now this Image of God, which, in us, conſiſts in the habitual poſſeſſion of his moſt glorious, and, as far as they are capable of being called communicable, perfections, is that which beſt diſtinguiſhes us from beaſts; and our ſouls themſelves, when they are immers'd in matter, and converſe only with ſenſual objects, do as it were
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:36404:95"/>loſe their nature, and tincture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their converſation; and ſo much the leſs rational they become, by how much the leſs they are virtuous, and religious. And therefore <hi>Grillus,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch, (Phaed.),</hi> reaſons, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts well, when he affirms, that if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be once taken from men, they are not only nothing better than Brutes, but more miſerable; For that being ſubject to many evils, their troubles are accented, and their diſquietments enlarged beyond the perception of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, of a meaner and more inſenſible nature. 'Tis Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that perfects and conſummates the beings of men; that cauſes them to aſpire to Glory, through all the croſſes and afflictions of this world, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them for an endleſs immortality; And, in this, it renders them far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the lower Brutes, who live ſome time, and then die, and periſh. Now ſuch being the fruits which grow with, and are born upon, our prayers, to which Religion has ſo natural a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, that, whenever it is genuine, and ſincere, 'tis bleſſed with the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a glorious off-ſpring; and prayer, and devotion riſing up at laſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:36404:95"/>into the poſſeſſion of eternal life; this conſideration cannot but convince us that prayer is both our priviledge, and our duty, if we either regard God, or our ſelves, the honour of our Maker, or our uninterrupted and eternal wellfare. The great God, has appointed prayer to be the means, through the interceſſion of our Saviour, to procure to us Grace here, and Glory hereafter; and we invert the methods of Divine Providence, when we expect the conveyance in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way. For though he that is Omniſcient, knows our wants, and what is not preſent to make us happy; Although he is acquainted with his own reſolutions, nor can we preſcribe methods to him, or with modeſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſire more than he has promiſed, and intends to grant; Yet in prayers, directed by his moſt holy word, he commands us to ask, in order to our obtainment of what he vouchſafes to give; nor will he be inclined to beſtow his bleſſings without the ſignification of our deſires. <hi>Vuit Deus rogavi, vult cogi, vult quâdam importunitate vinci,</hi> (ſayes St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>bona eſt haec vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> &amp;c. God will be intreated,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:36404:96"/>he will be compell'd, he will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a certain importunity; this is a good violence, when, in prayer, we wreſtle with Almighty God, and like <hi>Jacob, we will not let him go, till he has left his bleſſing behind him.</hi> He loves, in our devotions, that we ſhould thus, with due humility, importune him, with demonſtration of kindneſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, at the ſame time, when, without fainting, we expreſs our wants; He will neither withhold grace, nor glory, nor any other good thing from theſe. And, certainly, if prayer be neceſſary to obtain ſuch things, without which we muſt be miſerable, both in this world, and in that which is to come; I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidenced prayer to be a duty incumbent upon all, who reſolve not to renounce their own happineſs, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe graces that are both gained, and exerciſed in it; who love commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God here, reſpect their eternal glory hereafter, and are not ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of themſelves, as for ever to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the means ordained for their own preſervation.</p>

               <p>THat I may now draw to a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Diſcourſe, I think I may juſtly infer from the whole, theſe three Propoſitions; the exemplifying of which, I ſhall be as brief in as I may, at leaſt, as ſhort as may comport with the bad times in which we live. (1.) That the Prayers, and Service of our own Church (<hi>The Church of</hi> England, <hi>Eſtabliſhed by the known Laws of the Land</hi>) are compoſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſuch a manner, that God will accept them. (2.) That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> offend him with theirs, and is moſt irrationally, and abominably pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in their devotions. And, (3.) That they who live amongſt us, and yet ſtrangely ſeparate from us, under the ſhelter, and pretence, of greater Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and a more pure Evangelical Worſhip, do not perform their ſervices unto God in ſuch a manner as is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Attributes, and Worſhip,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:36404:97"/>mans dependance, and that infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt their Creator, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And ſo upon the whole, it muſt appear to be an unreaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it may be plainly infer'd, That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> embodied with the State, allowed, and ſtrengthned by civil Sanctions, worſhips God in ſuch a manner as he accepts; and offers him ſuch a Spiritual Sacrifice, with which he is well pleaſed; that can no way be fruſtrated of its excellent deſign, but by a neglect in the devotioniſts, or, the bad lives of thoſe, who pretend thus to worſhip. This will appear, (though not only) from that which our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are pleaſed, ſometimes, to call a Club Argument; becauſe it is Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by a Royal Chriſtian Aſſent in Parliament; And yet this, as it makes for the intereſt, of thoſe who contend with us, becomes Sacred; though at other times, when the advice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with their own conſent, is by the King paſs'd into a Law; if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icts either their Principles, or their Humour, (and 'tis difficult to gueſs, which is the Commander) it ſhall be judged hard, or ſanguinary, or, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:36404:97"/>with that liberty, <hi>in which Chriſt has made us free;</hi> and a Text, uttered at firſt, upon a very far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent account, ſhall be as frequently urged, as it has been anſwered; <hi>We ought to obey God rather than men.</hi> So that ſuch perſons, are extremely for Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment according to Law, when this allows, or indulges their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and their Practice; but conclude it to be unequal, and unjuſt, when the ſame Laws condemn, and puniſh them; and they ſeem to be like a noble Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor accuſed, and now going to his Trial, who walks in ſtate, and, ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with an unconcerned mind, nay, many times, with joy, and briskneſs in his countenance, when the back of the Ax is turned towards him; but when, as he comes back again, the edge of the fatal inſtrument of death looks upon him, his face is demure, he treads the earth with trembling ſteps, and wiſhes there had been no Law to condemn him; and if he has any ſprightlineſs in his looks, his end is only by this ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ceremony, to perſuade the people, that he remains innocent, and that the Law is hard, by which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, though, perhaps, before,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:36404:98"/>when it ſerved his turn, and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too, nothing was like Government according to Law. But to leave this Argument, becauſe it may grieve ſome perſons, whoſe principles and zeal are managed ſuitable to their Secular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, although, I fear, it muſt be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual reaſon at laſt to convince them: Let us enquire, whether the Prayers, and Worſhip, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are not to be juſtified another way? This being a publick Worſhip of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Embodied, and Conſtituting the Sacred Society of a Church, who, with unity of hearts, and a ſuitable unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, meet together in a place devoted to the ſervice of God, and ſeparated from vulgar, and profane uſes; the prayers, and ſervice, muſt be allowed, by reaſonable perſons, to be ſuch as it ought to be, uttered in ſuch general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as all may be able to conſent unto, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſe and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. And where confeſſions, prayers, and thankſgivings, are more preciſely and particularly managed, and he, who is the mouth of the Congregation, invents his own unallowed prayers, and pretends to utter the concernments of all though ſome may be able to joyn in one part,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:36404:98"/>and ſome in another, yet, 'tis very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that any one can conſent to all; and all perhaps, had they time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, could not give their aſſent to one period, beſides thoſe that tell God his own; or ſome general things which are uſually declared, before he comes to what are called ſoul ſearching par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. I have heard of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> who, vouchſafing to hear one that was not of his own perſwaſion, and finding that the man who pray'd <hi>extempore,</hi> had laid a great heap of Confeſſions before him, and had been very curious in ſorting ſins into their ſeveral kinds and degrees, and uttering all in the name of the Congregation; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as if he had been uſed to chop Logick, makes his inference in this Dilemma: Either this man tells lies, or this people are very wicked, and reſolved to have no more to do with them. But another, perhaps, more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere than he, may think his concluſion very reaſonable, when he ſuppoſes, and infers that the man prays from his own experience, and from his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar defects, attributes the ſame to all mankind, and cauſes a multitude to be partakers of his private ſins, to petition
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:36404:99"/>what he only wants, and to give thanks for the benefits which he has received. And, perhaps, upon the conſideration of all, the mouth of the people may at laſt be thought the worſt member a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, whatever his headſhip may yet ſignifie. But not to confound Cloſets with Churches, nor yet to grant, that a ſingle man can hold a great Congregation in his belly: Let us take a proſpect of our own Church, and ſee whether we can juſtifie that, without finding faults in others. In this we offer up to God all thoſe deſires of our minds, that are fit for men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied into a Chriſtian Society, and who are partakers of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: We confeſs the general heads of ſin, of which all being guilty, they can from a ſhort reflection upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, truly acknowledge that they have been ſharers in; And if it ſhould be rendered more particular, ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be guilty, and ſo there would be a Schiſm in our acknowledgements, becauſe all could not give their aſſent, without telling a lie to their Maker, and ſuppoſing themſelves more vile than they are; And moreover this way of publick Worſhip would expoſe all
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:36404:99"/>the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, to the contempt of thoſe that are enemies to Religion; at leaſt adverſaries to that of the Goſpel. We have alſo, in the Service, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> owns, upon our Confeſſion, Gods free pardon declared to us, in that manner, as Chriſt himſelf has appointed in his Goſpel, without ſuch an Auricular confeſſion as may give us Knowledge of the Secrets of Princes, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter occaſion to diſturb the Order, and Government of the World; Which they, indeed, ought to introduce, who undertake to be ſo particular, and nice, in confeſſing the ſins of other men, or, praying for the things, individuals ſtand in need of. But to proceed; By our abſolutions, the true penitent is only incouraged; and that authority, which our Saviour left, with his laſt Commiſſion, to the Miniſters of his Goſpel, is kept up, and maintained, in purſuance of what Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, after his Reſurrection, when the ſtate of his humiliation ceaſed, and he was ready to aſcend with triumph to his Father, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23.): <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſe ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36404:100"/>we are directed, by the Order of our Church, to ſay our prayers day by day; that, ſo, we may, in the ſence of the Apoſtle, <hi>pray without ceaſing;</hi> and <hi>continue inſtant in prayer;</hi> and, <hi>by vertue of our adoption, cry Abba Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And this, becauſe the preſcription of our bleſſed Lord himſelf, gives us both a pattern, and direction for, when he teaches us <hi>to pray for bread,</hi> (which is the ſtaff and ſupport of our lives) day, by day. As to the object of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we make our Supplications to God alone, through the Merits, and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt; and admit no creature to partake in the honour due to either. The matter of our publick prayers is ſuch, as includes our general wants; we always beg the pardon of ſin; to be delivered from temptations and evils; we petition alſo for Grace to aſſiſt us, it being the influence of the Spirit of God: And, in particular, we ask thoſe Theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, without which we cannot be ſaved. We pray more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, (as the Ancients did, even when they were perſecuted) <hi>for Kings, and all that are in authority; that under them we may lead godly and quiet lives:</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:36404:100"/>Nay, we petition for men of all ſorts, and in all circumſtances, that none may be ſhut out from the benefit of our prayers; and we beg all things that may be needful for our bodies, and our ſouls. We pray for happy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year; for prevention of, and deliverance from, all Plagues that may hurt the body, and all evils that may aſſault the ſoul: We pray againſt all the bad accidents, and misfortunes, of our lives, and that we may eſcape violence, and ſudden death; Becauſe, (notwithſtanding the notions ſome have of Predeſtination) death may be too ſurprizing to the beſt; and, if not prevented by the Providence of God, may advance towards, and ſeize, us, too, before we are prepared to receive it; and therefore, we, further, petition Heaven, that we may be fitted for our laſt encounter, and that we may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with Chriſtian comfort, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to, and have a ſafe deliverance at, the day of Judgment. We pray not, indeed, for the Souls of men after their departure out of this lower world; Becauſe we believe, according to the Scriptures, <hi>that as the tree falls, ſo it lies:</hi> and as death finds us, ſo will
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:36404:101"/>Judgment too. Nor do we know, (and, <hi>how can we unleſs it were revealed?</hi>) of any middle place, where the ſouls of men may ſuffer to their improvement, and be purged by any material fire. (If we could ſuppoſe it to operate upon an immaterial being.). Yet we pray, as far, for men departed this life, as the Primitive Chriſtians ever did, and the form of our bleſſed Lord, teaches us, in that Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come: viz.</hi> That, in order to the coming of the Kingdom of Glory, God would bring the juſt, that are departed this life, to an happy, and a bleſſed, Reſurrection; that ſo Chriſts Church, which is Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on Earth, may, finally, become Triumphant in the Heavens. And, we, always, give thanks, for the examples, and triumphs of thoſe, who have died in the true faith of Chriſt, that we may rejoice with them; whoſe joy is now full, according to their capacity, and ſhall, at the great day, be much more enlarged. Our Liturgy is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently framed, that, as there is no ſort of men, but what we have ſome petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for; So there is no condition we can be caſt into, but the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who join in our Service, ſhare
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:36404:101"/>with us in ſympathy and affection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt remember us in our common Church prayers: And of this the <hi>Litany</hi> is ſo full and expreſſive, that particular Collects ſeem to be redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, when this is uſed: yet we have even theſe too, very ſuitable to the ſtate of any that would deſire that their grievances may be expreſſed to Almighty God by him who offers up the prayers of the Congregation; As far as modeſty and cleanneſs of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is able to preſent them; (though not in thoſe terms in which they were formerly pitch'd up with a fork to load a Pulpit) and the Miniſters hearty wiſhes are aſſiſted by the devout affections, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of the people. In a word, our Church directs, and her true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Sons practiſe, what the Apoſtle adviſes the <hi>Philippians</hi> to do (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>In every thing, by prayer, and ſupplication with thankſgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> And, as they whom the Apoſtles firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian faith, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles <hi>doctrine; and fellowſhip; and in breaking of bread; and in prayer.</hi> Our Creeds, in which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:36404:102"/>we make the publick profeſſion of our faith, contain all Articles, but yet no more, than the pureſt Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world have, in all Ages of their Religion, declared: They are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtuffed with the additions of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor have we abated by the omiſſions of ancient Hereticks, or any that bear a newer date; nor do we receive any point of faith, but what is plainly evident in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: And, for theſe, we own neither ſpurious, nor generally doubted Books. Our fellowſhip, or ſociety, is upheld, as all others muſt be, by thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to govern, and thoſe whoſe duty it is to obey: And, in the quality of our Rulers, we have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſome other Churches that are yet Proteſtant, in that we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Biſhops, for whoſe order, in the Chriſtian Church, (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any perſonal failures, to which all that is called man is ſubject; or the malicious imputations of any wicked and unreaſonable men:) we have the ſame evidence (if this word, too, is not in diſgrace) and conſent among the Antients for fifteen hundred years, as we have for the Baptiſm of Infants,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:36404:102"/>for the aboliſhing of the day of the Jewiſh Sabbath, and, inſtead of it, for the eſtabliſhment of the obſervation of the Lords Day: And, as far as I can yet learn, all the three ſeem to ſtand upon the ſame foundation; and, if they fall, they muſt be ruined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our Sacraments are no more, than what our bleſſed Saviour inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and commanded alſo to be uſed in his Church, that we might have ſome viſible ſigns, which, by vertue of his bleſſing, might ſignifie, and convey to us ſpiritual grace. And, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the prayers and praiſes, in our publick worſhip, are ſuch, as, beſides their fulneſs to repreſent the wants and gratitude of men, are uttered and performed with decency, gravity, and ſolemn devotion; (unleſs we chance from one party or other to get a kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Prieſt among us) both the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the people bearing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſhares in them, that every mouth may pray unto, and praiſe, the Lord. Due and comely geſtures of our bodies are enjoyned, according to thoſe cuſtoms that are ſignificant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly known in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in which we live; and alſo due
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36404:103"/>affections and intentions of our minds: Beſides, all is done in our Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; that we may not kneel like Camels, to our burden; but Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may be perfect freedom; and we may not depart from our own manhood, but act rationally and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly in all our devotions, when, by ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> we give our conſent to what (being a form, in our common Language) we do, or may, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtand before 'tis uttered. And where there are ſome repetitions, they are not vain; (which will be proved in the handling my laſt Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) but either they are in diſtinct ſervices, or elſe altered, by invoking every perſon in the Trinity apart. The Reſponds are juſtifiable, both from the ancient Service of the Jews, and by the practice of the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; which has frequently been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and enlarged on, by ſeveral Writers of our own Church: And the Rites, and outward Circumſtances, of our devotion, as Ceremonies attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are but few, and therefore cannot be burdenſom; and as few as may be that concern the people, which are abundantly juſtified in Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi>'s
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36404:103"/>Defence of the three innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, uſually bound up with the Conference before King <hi>James,</hi> at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court;</hi> which is a Treatiſe that may ſatisfie any impartial perſon, that will without prejudice read, and peruſe it with judgement, without putting a bar to his own ſatisfaction, by a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolution, never to be convinced. Theſe things, therefore, being only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that attend our devotion, relating to habits or geſtures, or ſigns of our profeſſion, cannot be Sacraments, becauſe the inſtitution of our Saviour is wanting; but, being in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent, they are only made neceſſary by the command of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, whom, in ſuch things, the Scripture enjoyns us to obey: and they may, by the ſame authority, be either abated or taken on, by which they are now commanded; and their being ſymbolical, is ſo far from being an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt their impoſition, that if they were not ſo, they would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, and not fitting to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at all. And thus I have, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral only, preſented to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of impartial men, the publick Service and Devotion of our Church,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36404:104"/>which is enough to make it plainly appear, that we worſhip God in ſuch a manner as is acceptable to him; and that we offer him a Sacrifice with which he is well pleaſed: if his Word be true, the practice of other Churches are to be at all exemplary unto us; and Chriſtianity it ſelf has been fairly handed down through the ſeveral Ages that have paſſed before us. If any one would ſee this more particularly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, let him read Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> on the Services of our Church: or, at leaſt, Dr. <hi>Beveridges</hi> Sermon at the opening of his Church.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Inference from the former Diſcourſe of prayer, is, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs offend God exceedingly in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, and uſual prayers; which appear openly to be impious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to all true and ſober Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and all mankind, who judge of things by Scripture, and juſt reaſoning from it, or indeed by their own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſentiments. Nay, they are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> ſo much, that they hinder the converſion of many to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity, and cauſe them to keep themſelves divided from ſuch men, who worſhip God after ſo undue and irrational a model, and joyn Saints and Angels with him, whilſt they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſuch things from them, as are reſerved to Gods prerogative to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; not only temporal advantages, but ſpiritual, and eternal; even grace here, and glory hereafter. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:36404:105"/>ſuch things, with the Types and Pictures which they fall down before, and worſhip too, thinking, like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to transfer their honour, they give to theſe, through them, to the Antitypes and Originals, muſt needs be as offenſive to God, as they are to the eyes and ears of thoſe, who being Chriſtians, are ſoberly religious, or ſuch who worſhip Almighty God as an infinite, living, Spirit. I need not now enter upon the debate, whether what I ſhall preſently charge them with, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes plain Idolatry in it? This they have frequently been accuſed of; and I find their evaſions (for I cannot well call them anſwers) to be very nice and thin; ſo that if they eſcape, they have good luck, to come ſo near the brink, and yet not fall into the ditch: They uſually quarrel about the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry, till people are weary of writing to them concerning a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, which they will not allow, nor return another; or elſe, they retire to their old hole guarded by two words that ſcare the people, though they underſtand them not. In this, they are like ſome perſons among our ſelves, who, as they think, ſeparate
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:36404:105"/>from us, upon hope of more high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and purer adminiſtrations; and yet, when they ſee an abſurdity following them, they preſently take ſhelter in a cloud; and, like Fiſh in a River, mudd themſelves. But, when men ſhall conſider, how jealous God is of his honour, and the greatneſs and unpardonableneſs of ſuch monſtrous crimes, when they are perſiſted in, that give away Gods glory to another; and place a Creature in his own Throne, whilſt, in the mean time, they debaſe his Majeſty to the low degree of ſome of the works of his hands: when rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal men ſhall reflect on ſuch things as theſe; if they have any love, or fear, of God, and believe, that they muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their actions; certainly, they will not approach ſo near the limits and confines of Idolatry, as to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in the worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, when the moſt ſubtil evaſion, which the moſt acute among them have to free themſelves from the guilt of Idolatry, conſiſts only in a nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and a bold pretenſion that they offer their ſervice ultimately to God, though they make ſome (as they think) glorified
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:36404:106"/>creatures, the more immediate objects of their prayers, and adoration, through whom they will have all to paſs, to the great Maker, and Creator of all. And yet he has no where appointed this; but directed all, who pretend to his ſervice, to make their addreſſes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to himſelf, only through the merits of Chriſt. But, before I quite diſmiſs this charge, which has occaſioned learned Books, and ſeems to be a great Controverſie with the Papiſts in our times; I muſt acquaint the Reader, that there is one part of their worſhip, in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which is the adoration of the Hoſt, that <hi>Coſter</hi> the Jeſuit, (in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrid. controv. Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.) ſays, cannot eſcape this charge upon it, if the foundation of it be not true. For (ſays he) if the true ſubſtantial body of Chriſt be not in that Sacrament; but what we receive is, in ſubſtance, only <hi>bread, and wine;</hi> Chriſt dealt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily with his Church, who, by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own words, <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> left it for 1500 Years together, in ſo great an error, and ſuch Idolatry as was never ſeen, or heard of in the world; And, moreover, he delivers, in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:36404:106"/>proof of this laſt aſſertion; That their error was much more tolerable, who worſhipped a Gold, or Silver Statue, or, any Image of other matter for God, (as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in time paſs'd, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped theirs, or, ſuch as worſhip a piece of red Cloth, lifted up on the top of a Spear, as is reported of the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> or living creatures, as ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did) than the error of thoſe, who worſhip a bit of bread, which, hitherto (ſays he, but very falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the Chriſtians have done, ſuppoſing Tranſubſtantiation not true. So, that according to their own confeſſion, (if the ſenſe of this Doctor renders his own opinion probable); If our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſubſtantial, and corporeal <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> be not in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; But Chriſts words, are to be underſtood Figuratively, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the expreſſions uſed before, in the celebration of the Paſſover, in which Proteſtants have an apparent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in their proofs, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; then any man may ſafely ſay, that the Papiſts are Idolaters, when, they worſhip a wafer, inſtead of God; Nay, the worſt ſort of Idolaters in the world, as the Jeſuit ſays in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:36404:107"/>place. And this deſerves not, in reaſon, any ſevere cenſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; becauſe, upon their Doctrine of probabilities, the opinion of any one allowed Doctor among them, may be ſafely followed, without peril of damnation; And upon the ſame principle, it may be very lawful to ſhift opinions, when theſe Doctors, contradict one another. This I am ſure, when urged home, by one that has more skill in Controverſie, than I, will take off that, by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to charge thoſe Proteſtants with great uncharitableneſs, who draw this impeachment high againſt them, when they accuſe them of Idolatry, in their adoration of the Hoſt: And inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the beſt anſwer they have, upon the ſuppoſition, that Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is falſe; <hi>viz.</hi> That, 'tis true to them, becauſe they believe it; and, therefore, although adoration of the Hoſt would be Idolatry in another, of a contrary perſuaſion, yet, they cannot be guilty of ſuch a crime; Becauſe, they worſhip not the Bread, which they believe, upon the words of conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be abſent; but the Divinity of Chriſt, which, they ſuppoſe to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:36404:107"/>together with his body, and his ſoul: And, If it be ſo, then after they have conjured him into the accidents of <hi>bread and wine,</hi> ſo that theſe hide him from any diſcovery, by the bodily ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of mankind; they ſeem firſt to make him preſent, then adore what they have ſo made, and at laſt eat up, and devour him, unleſs they can again ſlip him away betwixt their fingers, and their teeth together. Yet, if Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, which is the foundation of all this, be falſe, then we may ſtill charge the Papiſts with Idolatry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the probable opinion of the Jeſuit. But what have we, dull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, to do with this, or their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of probabilities, by which they, only, innocently deſign to ſerve their own turns? To enter upon ſuch points too far, will overdo my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; And I may, in the winding up of the bottom, be accuſed for charging the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church with the Doctrines, and concluſions, of particular men, and cauſing all the excellent orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to ſpeak by the mouths of the Jeſuits, which ſome Papiſts, (for deſigns beſt known to themſelves) will readily, and not without cauſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:36404:108"/>all things, confeſs to be the moſt pernicious Order, (or rather Sect) that ever was eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the worſt in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World). Let us leave this then, and come out from among them, and meddle no longer with the nice affairs of particular Societies. It will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for my preſent purpoſe, if, from my precedent Diſcourſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I may juſtly, and by due conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, infer, that the Publick Service of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſuch, as is repugnant to Gods revealed Will; that it may juſtly be branded with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, according to the proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word; that it is ſuch, as the greater number, of thoſe, who are commonly preſent at it, cannot accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with due, and proper intentions of their minds; that their prayers are ſuch, as God has no where promiſed to hear; and their methods of addreſs, ſuch as Chriſtianity never preſcribed, nor were, by any Church, in the firſt times ever practiſed; nay, not by their own, till they had debauched the beſt Religion in the World, to advance themſelves; corrupted good Manners, and cauſed the principles of the Goſpel,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:36404:108"/>to truckle to their fancies, and began to Sacrifice to their own net, and made St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſors at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fiſhermen, as catched only ſuch Fiſh, as brought money in their mouths, making merchandize of mens ſouls, that they might gain a Temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by the traffick. Theſe are Heads ſufficient for a Proteſtant to Diſcourſe upon. But I muſt omit ſuch, and many more, if I dilate cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, to what I have confined my ſelf. And therefore, I ſhall not now make diſcovery of that apparent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the people, nay, the Prieſts too, unleſs they conſecrate, of half their Communion, in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper; whilſt they think a pretty invention of concomitancy, will excuſe their theft; when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour inſtituted, and gave, the ſigns <hi>of his body and blood,</hi> diſtinct from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his real death might be the better ſignified, ſince his <hi>blood</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſeparated from his <hi>body.</hi> Nor, ſhall I write at this time, concerning the villany of their Confeſſions, and Abſolutions; which, as they uſe them to baſe, and bloody, and Secular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:36404:109"/>are moſt intolerable; nor of all the ridiculous, indefenſible, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom Ceremonies, with which they uſually ſo load their devotions; that, baffling all true Evangelical worſhip, confound the intentions of mens minds, turn the reaſonable ſervice of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into Pageanty, and Stage play, make their prayers, which they pretend to offer, nothing but an external ſhew, the labour of the lips, and outſide devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, turning their Prieſthood into ſuch a trade, that all the preparation of Learning, and Divinity, can enter them but Novices into the Schools of Exerciſe, and they had need ſerve ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apprentiſhip, to teach them the poſtures, and Giggombobs of action: Though theſe, and many other things, as vain, and bad, are preſcribed, and commanded in their Books of Offices. The reaſon why I inſiſt not now on ſuch things as theſe, is, becauſe the main Subject of my Diſcourſe, being prayer only, I would not have my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, tranſgreſs the Rule, in charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adverſaries with ſuch Errors, as are not plainly to be concluded from the premiſſes. It will be ſufficient, at this time, to ſhew how abominable the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:36404:109"/>Popiſh allowed prayers are, without intermixing the things that attend them. Now, the Papiſts muſt needs offend God with their publick prayers, and conſequently muſt enrage, inſtead of appeaſing, him, becauſe they are not ſuitable to his Sacred word, nor, that Worſhip which Chriſtians, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times, uſed in their publick Divine Service. And this will be confirmed by two reaſons: (1.) Becauſe their publick Prayers are in an unknown tongue. (2.) Becauſe, they pray to creatures, when they ought to pray to God only.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Publick Prayers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, are in an unknown tongue; ſometimes unknown to the Prieſt himſelf; who, by the help of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, the advantage he has of hiding his infirmities, in thoſe he pretends, as he is directed, to repeat ſecretly, and, by frequent uſe, can untowardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them. But more eſpecially are they unknown to the people; at leaſt the generality of them, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any reaſon be ſuppoſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand languages beyond what their Mothers taught them; unleſs Mother Church can inſpire them with cloven
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:36404:110"/>tongues, and turn all its Children into Apoſtles. For <hi>Latin,</hi> in which the <hi>Roman</hi> publick prayers are uttered, is now become a learned Language, in all thoſe Dominions, which the Pope over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads, and ſhadows with his wings; and, the gaining of it, requires a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, from vulgar, education, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general Language of no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the World; and, therefore, how ſhould the multitude of a Nation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it? Now Publick Prayer, as I have ſhewed before, ought to be ſo compoſed, for matter, and words, that all, who are bound to join in it, ſhould fully underſtand it, that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, before they give their conſent to it; that, ſo they may heartily agree in each petition, and ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> at the cloſe, and period. But how can peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple poſſibly conſent, or, intend their minds, and engage their affections, with any reaſon, to ſuch a ſervice, which is uttered in a language, which they underſtand not? In ſuch a caſe, they may, by the impoſition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, blaſpheme God, when they think that they adore him, and wiſh for a curſe, inſtead of a bleſſing. And, yet this is the general practice of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:36404:110"/>Church: And would be, as it was, in <hi>England,</hi> were it eſtabliſhed again: Though I may, notwithſtanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſparagement to any, ſuppoſe, that many that may peruſe this writing, however many, that heard it from the Pulpit, cannot pretend to underſtand <hi>Latin.</hi> And yet this Service is, what all perſons, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, are obliged to, under moſt rigid, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties; unleſs they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Decrees of that Council, (beyond the Controverſie of our Neighbouring Nation) which, they muſt own to be general, and infallible, though both the adjuncts are falſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. For the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> (<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.) determines, for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and brutiſh ſervice, and obliges thoſe, who underſtand not the Language: But not without due cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Decree; that a power of diſpenſing, may remain to the Pope (in caſes, that may beſt ſerve his turn) with thoſe, to whom he thinks fitting, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Prayers in their vulgar Language: who may be inclinable to receive, or elſe to recall, baniſhed, Popery. For the Council has worded their Decree of this, as if they were afraid of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:36404:111"/>of thoſe, who, on the Apoſtles ſide, maintain prayers in a Known Tongue, but deſpiſe the contrary: <hi>viz.</hi> That it has ſeemed to the Fathers, not to be expedient, that every where Maſs ſhould be laid in the vulgar tongue. This not to be expedient, is a ſoft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which they can, when they pleaſe, explain, effectually, that it is not lawful; and every where, when it ſerves their turn, will be eaſily exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for, any where. But it helps <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> very much, in his anſwer to the argument, againſt the neceſſity of <hi>Latin</hi> Service, from the Popes Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to the <hi>Moravians,</hi> to uſe the <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian</hi> Language, in their Divine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and helps forward the like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to our ſelves, for a preſent turn, in this matter; were we ſo well prepared, as a late executed Papiſt thought, to acknowledge the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Pope, and in other things, to conform ſo much to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that it might, in time, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain compleatly planted amongſt us; that ſo the Pope, might receive plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fruits from thoſe trees, which, from <hi>Rome,</hi> he had tranſplanted into ſo rich a ſoil, as <hi>England</hi> is. But at laſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:36404:111"/>queſtion, (whatever might be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the firſt) we ſhould be ſerved, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us, the <hi>Moravians</hi> were, even turned wholly to our <hi>Latin</hi> Service, when the Pope had raiſed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts of his own, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themſelves, and curb others, and <hi>England</hi> were well inhabited by <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But they, who can diſpenſe with Gods Law, may eaſily diſpenſe with one of their own: Eſpecially, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, in ſome things, may be a convenient inſtrument, to confound the principles which men, being uſed to, are loth to renounce all at once; and, to introduce others gradually, till they embrace all. Thus, 'tis uſual for one, who intends to drive a flock of ſheep before him; he will let them feed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their bounds, till he is got on the commanding ſide of them, and then he drives them into what Coop, or Pen, he pleaſes. And, truly we, who, by the favour of God, and piety of Princes, <hi>Profeſs the truly Ancient, and Apoſtolick Faith;</hi> had need walk circumſpectly, and look about us, for fear of thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſnares that are ſet for us, by Popiſh Emiſſaries, to catch, and impriſon us firſt, that they may, in triumph, lead
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:36404:112"/>us Captives to their great Prince, and Maſter. For the Pope is like the old Serpent, if you once allow him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Supremacy, he will quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Infallible, and then our whole Cauſe is loſt: Give him but an hole for his head to peep through, and it will not be long, ere he wriggles in his whole body. But (Bleſſed be God) we have no need of him; though he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers, that he has need of us: Nor do we deſire to partake in, or rob him of, his ſervice; but to continue in our own moſt holy Worſhip; And, if we can help it, he ſhall not take it away from us. 'Tis true, indeed, ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have thought us to be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared for their Communion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualified with vice and debauchery enough; which they themſelves have been teaching us for many years, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their advantage from that unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Loyal joy, which poſſeſs'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Kings Return, to take his Right, and to ſit upon that Throne, from which he was barr'd by Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Force. But this great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration being the, handy-work of God, the Devil, and <hi>Rome,</hi> thought to have their advantage by it, and have
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:36404:112"/>ſeveral years tried their skill, but Gods Providence was too hard for them. And even yet, (praiſed for ever be the great name of the eternal <hi>Jehovah</hi>) though the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> as well as other weak, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, men have thought us march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly towards <hi>Rome;</hi> we have a Proteſtant King, to rule, and govern, us, ſuch generous, and faithful Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who adviſe him, and ſuch skilful, and ſtout Champions, to encounter them; and, above all, the God of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to undermine, and reſiſt them; that we may yet ſay, <hi>The Lord is our helper; we will not fear what man can do unto us, Nay, though an hoſt of men ſhould be encamped againſt as, we will not ſlavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhly fear evil;</hi> although we are ſenſible, that in this Cauſe of Religion, (which loves not to be planted with the point of a Sword) our Adverſaries have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed their writings, for ſtrategems, left their Arguments, and were almoſt ready to run to their weapons. But whither will zeal tranſport a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the preſent ſubject of debate, when he meets with an enemy, that is always betraying, and ready to pierce a mans Bowels? I ſhall, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Argument, and Inference,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:36404:113"/>againſt the Papiſts prayers in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, with two Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſeem to me, to determine the Controverſie; and are ſufficient, with reference to this particular, to abate the kindneſs of any perſon, (at leaſt all that are well inſtructed) to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and check any inclinations to the embracement of ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whole conſtitution hinders them from underſtanding their prayers, that ignorance may make men fit for their devotions, and, parting with their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſence too, they may be drawn after the Popes Chariot, with their eyes put out, and, at laſt, be led into a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Purgatory, howling, and ſqualing, as if they were all <hi>Quakers,</hi> that he may, when he pleaſes, as the ſilver moves, open the doors, or, keep them faſt; and when he turns the Key at laſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving them joy, and liberty, they may find, they are entered into a real Hell, from which there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at all. But yet, before we go thither, or, pray away our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, in ſuch a worſhip, in which it is impoſſible for thoſe to joyn, who ken not <hi>Latin,</hi> in which it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: Let us, (1.) Conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:36404:113"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> be not above the Pope, and the word of God, rather to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, than the cunningly deviſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of men? This great Apoſtle, and Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14.) acquaints the World with ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as this; <hi>If I pray</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth; but my underſanding is unfruitful.</hi> By un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, every body knows what is meant; but in the latter clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome may be ignorant; and others make uſe of theſe expreſſions, and their own vanity, and unskilfulneſs together, to lead men from <hi>Latin</hi> Service, into a rude, and ungovernable devotion. By Spirit, therefore, is meant, the gift of the Spirit, not flowing forth in extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore expreſſions now, but in ſtrange languages in the times of the Apoſtles; as appears by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> interpretation of himſelf: For, when he had exhorted men to employ one of the Spiritual gifts, forementioned in this Chapter, to the edification of the Church; (<hi>ver.</hi> the 12th.) In the next he explains it, by <hi>an unknown tongue:</hi> Nay, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Text quoted, <hi>the praying of the Spirit,</hi> is, apparently, the praying in an unknown tongue; <hi>If I pray</hi> (ſayes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:36404:114"/>he) <hi>in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but mine underſtanding is unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> That is, though he underſtood the language himſelf; yet it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to others, his being acquainted with the ſenſe of his own prayers, could not render them beneficial to thoſe that heard them. And therefore he concludes upon the whole, that <hi>he would pray with the Spirit;</hi> yet ſo, that he might pray with the underſtanding too. He would not only pray in ſuch a language, by himſelf, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that he might accompany his words with due intention, and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affections: But he would pray alſo, that his underſtanding might be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto others, by putting his petitions into ſuch a language, as the people might be able to underſtand, that ſo they might joyn with him, and be edified by it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, that prayer, not underſtood by thoſe who are to joyn in it, being uttered in a language which they are ignorant of, loſes thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed influences and ends to which it was deſigned, and ought to have upon the Devotioniſts; particularly, by their underſtandings to move their wills;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:36404:114"/>and, obtaining their conſent, to raiſe their affections ſuitable to the petitions made for them; that ſo the act of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may become their own, and they, knowing what is delivered, may rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally conſent, and earneſtly deſire the things prayed for, and have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral intereſts in all. For, they are Beaſts, rather than men, who are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on they know not whither; and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch petitions, or, at all adventures, aſſert the truth of ſuch propoſitions, which they have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of, and may, with reference to their underſtandings, be as well falſe as true. In ſuch a caſe they fix their ſeal, either by the example, or authority, of another, to what, for ought they know, obliges them to ruin, and may ſign their execution when they hope to receive a pardon. It is impoſſible at man ſhould, with any reaſon, ſignifie his aſſent to that, or heartily wiſh for thoſe things, mentioned in a prayer, when he does not underſtand whether they are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it or no: Unleſs men can think it rational to ſet their hands, at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to every paper that is brought to them; when they may ſign a Bond, inſtead ofa Releaſe, or make away an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:36404:115"/>inſtead of making it ſure to them: But I may be confident, men are wary enough in this, and need not, unleſs they are fooliſh to a Proverb, any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor to caution them in it, though their want of skill may cauſe them to adviſe in ſome nice and critical difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And is it reaſonable, think ye, that the Children of this world ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wiſer than the Children of light? Or that any, to whom the glorious Goſpel is revealed, ſhould be more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and exact, in relation to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular welfare, than they are with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their eternal advantages? Will they beg a Serpent inſtead of a Fiſh, or deſire a Stone inſtead of Bread? A little Child will hardly be ſo gull'd and cheated; but, when ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is profer'd, will throw it away, with rage and contempt. But, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that which aggravates the fault of men ſo eaſily impoſed upon, is, that, where they give their aſſent without reaſon, and deſire what they do not underſtand, whether it be advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or unprofitable to them, they chuſe what is no object of their choice; becauſe it is impoſſible for them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any goodneſs at all in that,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:36404:115"/>whoſe nature and accommodation to them they are totally ignorant of; nor can any man give a true aſſent to that whoſe truth he cannot diſcern, nor has any overpowering reaſon to believe. This our own experience, upon reflection, muſt fully convince us of: Or if any that have immortal ſouls within them, and are quite ſunk into rottenneſs and clay, ſo that they will not, or cannot, intend their minds to receive ſatisfaction within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet, if they have ſenſe enough to be common Chriſtians, of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt form in the School of our Lord; the authority of his Apoſtle muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them; and they muſt, on divine revelation, believe, that praying in an unknown tongue muſt be nonſence and folly in him, that thus offers to God he knows not what, and conſents to that of which he has no knowledge at all. <hi>If I know not,</hi> ſays S, <hi>Paul, the meaning of the voice, I ſhall be to him that ſpeaketh, a Barbarian; and he that ſpeaketh, a Barbarian unto me.</hi> (1 Cor. 14.11.) And verſe the 16. <hi>When thou ſhalt bleſs with the ſpirit,</hi> (that is, as before, in an unknown tongue) <hi>how ſhall he that poſſeſſeth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:36404:116"/>the room of the unlearned ſay Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> give his aſſent) <hi>at thy giving of thanks, ſince he underſtandeth not what thou ſaieſt?</hi> To ſpeak or write more in ſuch a plain caſe would apparently diſparage an Auditory, and a Reader; and a man might be accuſed of waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and of rendring our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries very conſiderable in the defence of ſuch a point, in the management of which, they have little or nothing to ſay for themſelves, beſides this: That Latin Service, being formerly their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, when it was commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Weſtern Empire, they think it fitting and honourable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it ſtill, leſt a change might make them loſe the credit of Antiquity; though the principal reaſon of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divine Service in this language is gone, and becomes an argument that points a quite contrary way, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects all Churches to their vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; ſince the Latin is ſo far from being the common tongue, in which the multitude of men expreſs their thoughts, and come to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other, even, in thoſe places, in which, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the publick Service is injoyn'd to be uſed,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:36404:116"/>that the common people do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, even in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has one reaſon for it, above all that the great ones will let us know from themſelves; but yet they do not, here in <hi>England,</hi> ſtop our mouths; ſo that (bleſſed be God) we can ſpeak it for them; though they had rather that we would ſtill hold our tongues. Yet, the reaſon is this; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hiding, under an unknown tongue, the abomination and falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which they practiſe, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in their publick offices, their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are kept in great ignorance; and dark devotion nouriſhes them into a great zeal, and blind obedience, that the Prieſts may make impreſſions on them, and they may receive and embrace thoſe inſtrumental principles that pick their Pockets, for the advantage of holy Church, and empty their Purſes into the Popes Coffers. And this is the moſt weighty reaſon for their religion in thoſe particulars, in which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Primitive Chriſtianity. But yet, methinks I have ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the rational natures of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that, where they could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they would examine; and if
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:36404:117"/>they once arrived at that, they would quickly reject every Article of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Apoſtles Creed, and what the Reformed Proteſtant Church of <hi>England</hi> owns. And I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the generality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation (who cannot, if they have been any thing ſerious, but be well acquainted with the neceſſary points delivered in the Scriptures) would ſo loath and abhor the <hi>Roman</hi> Breviaries and Maſs-Books, were they faithfully tranſlated into our common Language, ſo that both parties might ſign the Copy, that the people would confute them themſelves, without the toil or pains of another. But the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> had rather ſtill lurk behind the Curtain, deal with the credulous, and lock up the Key of Knowledge, by keeping the Scriptures from the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the people; unleſs they are ſuch particular parts, as they think fit to afford them the peruſal of: This better ſerves their turn, than to permit a bold and inquiſitive multitude to view all, that they may make diſcoveries, and twattle to one another, and ſo, at laſt, make enquiries into thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:36404:117"/>of their Church, (which the Governours are willing ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted divine) till the people ſhould be able, by due ſearch, to confute the <hi>Roman</hi> Prayers by the Scriptures; and then, in a little time more, the <hi>Capitol</hi> it ſelf muſt be delivered, when they had no more <hi>Geeſe</hi> to defend it. I ſee therefore, in the <hi>Roman</hi> way, the blind muſt lead the blind, till both together fall into the ditch; where I ſhall, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, leave them, as to this point of <hi>Latin</hi> Service, till their Seers are able to pluck them out. For, when error is attended with an obſtinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to maintain it, even againſt the teſtimony of an Apoſtle, the perſons, thus poſſeſſed with it, are only to be treated as things inſenſible, not minding the authority, by which Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is eſtabliſhed. And when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus preſent petitions to Almighty God, which they cannot ſo much as pretend to underſtand, 'tis plain, that they offer the ſacrifice of fools; and their Prieſts ſacrifice to their own net; and 'tis in vain to perſwade in ſuch a caſe, where the people delight in their own ſlavery; and the Prieſts love their covetouſneſs too well, to forſake the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:36404:118"/>Trade, in which they can ſo eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on thoſe, whom, by ſuch means, they keep in ignorance, and ſo make an outſide godlineſs their gain. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the people, under the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, can only draw nigh to God, in their Publick Service, with their lips at beſt; when their hearts, and minds, being under an impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of accompanying them, muſt of neceſſity be far from him: and they loſe, alſo, the bleſſed influence of all their Publick Prayers on themſelves, in raiſing their affections, acting their graces, mortifying their ſins, and prompting them to their duty; all which, prayers, well compoſed, uttered, and underſtood, muſt needs effect upon the minds of well inclined De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votioniſts.</p>
               <p>And ſo I proceed to another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have againſt the Publick Prayers of the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> That they pray to Creatures, when they ought to pray to God alone. That God only is to be the object of our prayers in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, I have already ſhewed in the Third Chapter of this Diſcourſe; And that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pray to Angels, and Saints departed, their Service is ſo
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:36404:118"/>full and frequent an evidence of it, that they themſelves will not deny it. They endeavour, therefore, to juſtifie the thing, by the bold aſſertions of their own Authors, and without any plain authority but from the Heathens, and themſelves; and without any ſolid and ſubſtantial argument. Yet, that I may give the Reader an hint or two, that none, unleſs he has a brow of braſs, may ſay to thoſe who underſtand not, or elſe never look'd into their allowed Breviary, or their common and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Maſs-Book, that we charge them with what they are not guilty of: I muſt inſtance in a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, in which prayers are made to glorified creatures, and to ſome inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate things too, in the publick Offices. of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; ſince ſome of the profeſſors of that Religion are ſo bold, and apparently wicked, that, to ſerve a turn, they will affirm, 'tis dark in the face of the Sun, and light even in the midſt of darkneſs; and nothing, almoſt, according to their principles of equivocation, and mental reſervation, if they take alſo the Doctrine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinions in to their aſſiſtance, can be propounded, but they may either
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:36404:119"/>affirm, or deny, as it makes for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their Church. Nay, they are bound, according to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> to ſay, that Vertue is Vice, or Vice Vertue, if the Pope ſo concludes either. But yet my preſent charge is ſo apparently true, that all muſt own it to any that have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their publick Service; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may, at any time, reply to the ignorant that receive the charge upon the authority of others. For, in their <hi>Commune Apoſtolorum,</hi> there is an Hymn conſiſting both of prayer and praiſe, in which we find theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; <hi>Vos ſaecli juſti judices! &amp;c.</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtles, they ſay, <hi>O ye juſt Judges, and Lights of the world, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you with the deſires of our hearts, to hear the prayers of your ſupplicants: ye that ſhut the heavens with a word, and unlock them again, looſe us we pray you from all our ſins, by your command: you to whoſe authority is ſubject both the health and miſery of all,</hi> &amp;c. In their Office to the Bleſſed Virgin you have theſe expreſſions, <hi>O</hi> Mary! <hi>Mother of Grace, Mother of Mercy? protect us from the enemy, and receive us at the hour of death. And let the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>together
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:36404:119"/>with her off-ſpring, beſtow her bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us;</hi> and the like. I ſhall inſtance, yet, in one more, (although, many know, I might tranſlate a multitude of the ſame nature into this Diſcourſe) and that ſhall be in the ſervice relating to one who was the Founder of one of the moſt pernicious Sects that ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the Chriſtian world; in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to many of whom the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> were Saints; the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> were of a Religious Order; the Great <hi>Turk</hi> becomes a Chriſtian, and the wild Fanatick is temperate and mild. I mean <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> who founded the firſt Society of the Jeſuits, to perplex and confound the Councils of Princes, and carry on miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt us, as well by thoſe who have been at the top, as thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the bottom of the Ladder. In the Service at the Celebration of his Feſtival, there is this Prayer, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect on the one and thirtieth day of <hi>July: O God! who, for the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of thy glory, haſt ſtrengthened thy Church militant,</hi> (properly ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed under the command of a Jeſuit) <hi>with a new aid by bleſſed</hi> Ignatius; <hi>grant that we who ſtrive, or fight, on earth, by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:36404:120"/>the imitation and help of him, may deſerve, with him, to be crowned in the heavens.</hi> And if they all deſerve the ſame lot, may they together poſſeſs the ſame place; for fear they ſhould be as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to us in the other world, as they have been in this. But I will no longer employ my ſelf in tranſlating their prayers. Many inſtances of their petitions, to Saints and Angels, have been expoſed to view, in moſt Books that have been by Proteſtants written againſt them. I heartily wiſh, that thoſe, who uſe ſuch prayers, underſtood them better; becauſe they would, then, more eaſily ſee how poyſon is wrap'd in gilded pills. Why ſhould I relate the Attributes which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives to the Croſs of Chriſt? as great as to him who ſuffered on it; and yet have no method to ſhift their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, but by the ſame way in which they tranſlate their prayers, and praiſes too, from the Croſs, to him who died upon it. And though I love not to purſue a Lion to his den, for fear that being weary, he may be hungry too, and take ſome opportunity to rend and devour: Yet it would be a ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from a Proteſtants mouth, that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:36404:120"/>which muſt needs grate upon the ears of all the devout worſhippers of God, and ſuch as believe that their prayers are heard, only through the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt: <hi>Sancta Crux! or a pro nobis. Holy Croſs! pray for us.</hi> And <hi>Ave Crux, ſpes unica. Hail Croſs, our only hope,</hi> would be words that to us would not only ſeem ridiculous, but, abominable; and, if at all conſidered, to any that hope in the mercy of God, through him who ſuffer'd and dyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs. But, notwithſtanding all, theſe are things as common with the Papiſts, as whining, and another ſort of nonſence are among ſome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, that pretend to ſet themſelves at the greateſt diſtance from them. Nay, any may ſee, (if they have skill, and leiſure, to peruſe it, in an office of, or relating to, the Holy Croſs, Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> (1664.) by publick authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch ſtrange expreſſions as theſe are: After it has begun with a Prayer to God, to free men from their enemies by the Sign of the Croſs, (which, if we ſhould make a thouſand times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, we ſhould hardly be quit from thoſe that are ſo devout to it) we find, afterwards, theſe expreſſions,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:36404:121"/>
                  <hi>O Crux venerabilis, &amp;c.</hi> I know not how they may edifie in <hi>Latin;</hi> but I am ſure, that they ſound harſh in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh;</hi> and good or bad, thus they run; <hi>O venerable Croſs! who haſt brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us miſerable; with what praiſes ſhall I extoll thee? becauſe thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared heavenly life for us.</hi> And, in the cloſe of another Hymn, the ſtyle, tho' a new one, is in theſe words, <hi>O victory of the Croſs, and admirable ſign! make us to triumph in the Celeſtial Court; or the Court of Heaven.</hi> But this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful task to me, thus to tranſcribe the moſt abominable Popiſh Prayers, and as unpleaſant, as it can be, to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to read it. And therefore I ſhall not fill theſe Papers with thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular addreſſes, which many of them make to individual Saints (as they account them) who are departed this life, for particular things, which they ſuppoſe to be in the power of them ſingly to beſtow, whilſt they appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate one faculty to one, and a ſecond to another; whilſt they conſtitute a firſt to be a Patron to their Horſes, another to their Sheep, a third to their Hoggs, and another to keep off ſome Diſeaſe from themſelves, or at leaſt, to cure it:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:36404:121"/>And ſo they make them Grooms, or Farriers, or Swiniards, or Shepherds, or Phyſicians, or Mountebanks, or what they pleaſe: For I am weary of raking in ſuch a dunghill, in which there is, neither Barley-corn nor Jewel. We may know their opinion, and practice too, in this point, from <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who was the great Champion for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that, at the cloſe of every Tome of his Controverſies, he joyns the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with God, in the thanks he renders for help in the compoſure; <hi>Praiſe be given to God and the bleſſed Virgin.</hi> Nay, <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds him in the Tranſport; For he (poſſibly as he thought from good manners) puts the Virgin before her Son, in the cloſe of ſome of his Books; and ſayes, <hi>Laus Deo, &amp; beatae Virgini Mariae, &amp; Domino Jeſu Chriſto. Praiſe be to God, and to the bleſſed Virgin</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>and to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which, whether his meaning were to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a new Trinity, by diſcarding the old, omitting the Holy Ghoſt, and changing that Sacred Perſon for the Mother of our Lord, I muſt leave to the judgement of others. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, in the Battel at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:36404:122"/>plainly aſcribed, not to God, but to the conduct of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Feſtival in memory of it, called <hi>Feſtum Sanctae Mariae à victoriâ,</hi> celebrated at the beginning of <hi>October.</hi> 'Tis a common thing for the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in their prayers to Angels, or departed Saints, not only to beſeech them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedein their behalf, when interceſſion for men, in Heaven, is plainly founded on their Redemption upon Earth; and therefore Chriſt who is the Mediator of Redemption, is alone capacitated; to be the Mediator of Interceſſion: But they rely, alſo, on thoſe whom they invoke, in ſuch caſes, for aid, and protection, nay, for grace here, and glory hereafter; and, in conſequence of this, all their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly invented diſtinctions will never bring them off from the horrid guilt, of giving away Gods Glory to another, ſince by their petitions, they imply a dependance on creatures, whom they invoke, for ſuch things as are in Gods power alone to give, what ever Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſome of them may be, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the bleſſings of Heaven to us. And this muſt be odious in the ſight of God, as it is abominable to all good men, who underſtand what Religion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:36404:122"/>means. But let us allow the evaſions of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in theſe points, to be as cunning, and plauſible, and witty as they pleaſe: Yet is not ſtrange, that the Governours of a Church, ſhould compoſe prayers, in ſuch language, and ſtile, that the firſt, and natural ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words, muſt lead the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into Error, and Idolatry? Unleſs you ſuppoſe them to be all Schoolmen, that underſtand how to ſplit an hair, and know how to pick ſtraws well, that have the artificial knack of nicety and diſtinction, or heads ſo naturally made for abſtraction, that they ken a dictinction, as ſoon as 'tis invented, and uttered by another; and yet they can have nothing but theſe arts, and tricks, to ſave them from the edge of their own prayers and ſuch an edge as is fatal too. This is like making any point hard, that was before eaſie, that a man may have the honour of unridling the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his own making, and render the ſame eaſie again, and ſo end where he firſt began. This is only turning round over a rope, to bring ones head into its right place: And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe things are, let the firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors anſwer themſelves. It cannot
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:36404:123"/>otherwiſe appear to me, but that theſe things grow from Atheiſm, and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and are deſigned only to bring forth fruits convenient for this world, but no way procuring glory in the next. For if there is a God, whom men ought to worſhip with their minds, and ſouls, as well as with their bodies, in which all preſent at it, ought to be, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and in which they ſhould una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly join; what a monſtrous thing is it to have the expreſſions in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſo worded, that they are rightly to be underſtood, only by the Learned? Whilſt the people may, by the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Worſhip, in that to which they immediately addreſs, not underſtanding the force of a diſtinction, or, if they did, its acute operation to ſave themſelves from the danger they are in, by their Publick Service, be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in practice, though they might hate the name, and the thing too, if once they had it explained to them; however, their Prieſts, in the mean time, may ſhift for themſelves; and, 'tis beyond my knowledge, to know how they can. God deliver us from ſuch devotion, of which ſo groſs and thick ignorance is the Mother, which
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:36404:123"/>yet how far it may excuſe the vulgar, to whom, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, 'tis invincible; I ſhall leave to the great God to judge, together, with all thoſe, who are reſolved that their hazards ſhall be continued to themſelves, by refuſing to follow their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, but willingly permit their Prieſts, to lead them in the dark; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſier it ſeems, and, for ought they know, much more pleaſant to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways blind, than to ſee. Such are like the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> our Saviour rebukes, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 4.22.) <hi>Who</hi> are reſolved to <hi>worſhip in the mountain, although they know not what they worſhip.</hi> But let us, who are members of the beſt Church in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, continue to offer to the great God, ſuch prayers as we underſtand, that both the affections, and intentions of our minds, may bear a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our expreſſions; Let us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others do, devoutly pray to the Supreme God, in, and through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſince we are encouraged thus to come to the Throne of Grace, that we may find help in time of need. I have proved, in a former part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that God, only, is to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:36404:124"/>of our prayers; and that ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as we account Divine, is not to be given to another: I have alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our words, in prayer, muſt be plain, and intelligible, as well as they ought to be grave, and ſerious, that the intentions of our minds may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and guard the expreſſions of our tongues. But ſuch rules men appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently tranſgreſs, who pray in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which they do not underſtand, or, to Angels, or departed Saints, or, to a piece of Bread, when they adore the Hoſt, and worſhip a Wafer. Such things as theſe, were never heard of in the firſt, and pureſt, Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and God grant, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, again, be introduced among our ſelves, in theſe laſt Ages of the World; that ſo Chriſt may find a true faith, and devotion too, here upon the Earth, <hi>when he comes riding triumphantly in the Clouds, to paſs Sentence upon the whole world.</hi> Let us reſiſt the Pope, and his Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the ſame argument, by which our Saviour baffled the Devil; <hi>Get thee behind me Sathan; for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> (Matth. 4.10.). And this Example, and Text
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:36404:124"/>together, methinks, ſhould abaſh all pretending, and deter all real, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from making any Religious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to immortal Angels, or Saints departed; and much more to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more inferiour, conſtituted, only, by human fancy, to be the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of theſe; leſt God, ſuffering long by their ſins, may at laſt leave them to their own hardneſs, to believe a lie, and to a ſtrong deluſion to which they are enſlaved, that at laſt they may be damned, becauſe they have turned the glory of their Creator into the image of a creature; beguiling themſelves of their reward, in a voluntary humility, in worſhipping of Angels, (like the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtion of the Eſſens, among the <hi>Jews;</hi> or the Idolatry of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in the times of the Chriſtians) which the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> for (Chap. 2.18.). As if men were, at this time of the day, (who have more than enough evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) of the mind of thoſe whom St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> mentions in his Homilies on this Epiſtle, that ſaid, We muſt come to God by his Angels; and not by Chriſt, becauſe that is an honour too high for us: Againſt which error, this holy Father ſayes, is the chief deſign of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:36404:125"/>the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> I need not, I hope, ask my Proteſtant Readers, the queſtion which St. <hi>Paul</hi> propounds to the <hi>Romans,</hi> (Chap. 10.14.). <hi>How ſhall men call on him, in whom they have not believed?</hi> No more than I need, in our daies, mention that which follows next: <hi>How ſhall ye believe in him, whom ye have not heard? or how can ye hear without a preacher?</hi> Only this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome ſmall conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome men, though not any with others, who have a true Miniſtry; <hi>How can they preach, that are not ſent?</hi> 'Tis plain, even by the Confeſſions of ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, that there is no precept, or plain example, for prayer, either to Saints, or Angels, in the Scriptures; Yea, they bear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that Sacred petitions to both, have been rejected, even by thoſe unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Saints, and Angels, to whom they were offered, or actually made. Let not any, therefore, among all the Proteſtants of the true Eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as God has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly complained of others) <hi>leave the fountain of living waters, to hew to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves broken Ciſterns, that can hold none. But let us ſtand faſt in the unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:36404:125"/>in a true, holy, Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in our prayers, profeſſions, and Chriſtian Sacraments; <hi>And with one mind ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel; and let us nothing be terrified by our adverſaries;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us, (<hi>Philip.</hi> 1.27.). Thus continuing in the Communion of that Church, to which we do belong, <hi>and contending earneſtly for that faith, which was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Saints;</hi> God will either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us, by his power, from being ground by thoſe two Milſtones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which we ſeem, at preſent, to be placed, and give us an happy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from our Controverſies, and troubles; or, aſſuredly, <hi>give us a Crown of Glory,</hi> above the reach of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or Fanaticks. Ariſe, O Lord! Let thine enemies be ſcattered, and let them that hate thee, flee before thee. But do thou ariſe, alſo, and have mercy upon Sion; For the time to favour it, yea, the ſet time is come: So we that are thy people, and ſheep of thy paſture, will give thee thanks for ever, and will alwaies be ſhewing forth thy praiſe, from generation, to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>THe moſt ungrateful task is ſtill behind, whilſt I muſt argue <hi>with my Brethren according to the Fleſh,</hi> my dear Country-men, and fellow Proteſtants, who yet ſeparate from the beſt Eſtabliſhed Church in the world: Whilſt my laſt Inference muſt, to my great grief, be this: That they who now ſeparate from us, and yet live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, under the care, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt indulgent Prince, that ever ſwayed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter; And in a Church (over which, though he ſpreads his Authority) that has her arms open to all penitents; and, when they become void of all hypocriſie, <hi>She loves her Neighbours, as ſhe does her ſelf:</hi> Yet it will appear, from the former Diſcourſe, that thoſe who yet continue their ſeparation from us, under the pretence of greater Reformation, and a more pure, and Evangelical, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, do not pay homage, in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:36404:126"/>to the great God, in ſuch a manner as is ſuitable to his Attributes, mans dependance, and that infinite diſtance betwixt their Creator, and themſelves. For, if we conſider him as the Maker of men, endowed with all Glory, and Perfection, whoſe Greatneſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to his Being, and both Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; whoſe Power admits neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, or limits, beſides, what falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and contradictions may imply, in which eternal truth bounds it ſelf, his Eſſence, not admitting any imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Who is Omniſcient, and ſearches the inmoſt receſſes of the minds of men, views our retirements, and diſcerns our thoughts afar off; whoſe goodneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, has been ſo extended, as well in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as Providence, that he juſtly commands, and merits too, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Worſhip, and Adoration, which our moſt quick and ſprightly inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, guided either by pure natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by rules of his own Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is able to prompt us to the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of; And, laſtly, He is a God of that infinite ability to revenge indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties offered to him, that he can as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh the inſolence of thoſe, that either, contemn, or neglect, his worſhip,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:36404:127"/>or render himſelf mean by it, as he can incourage the devout, or bleſs thoſe who with humility petition it. So that reflecting on the looſe and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prayers of thoſe, who are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this Inference, we muſt (as I ſuppoſe) conclude, without any great difficulty, that upon the view of the matter, and circumſtances of their devotion, comparing it with what is due to ſo great a Majeſty, who is the Sovereign Commander, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the Univerſe, the worſhip of thoſe, whom I am now to deal with, does not comport with the greatneſs, and Supreme excellencies of himſelf. And this is far more eaſie to diſcern, than to limit, or preſcribe a ſuitable devotion. For as <hi>Cotta</hi> ſaies, in <hi>Cicero, de nat. Deor. lib.</hi> I. <hi>Mihi non tam facilè in mentem venire ſolet quare verum ſit aliquid quam quare falſum.</hi> I cannot ſo readily give a reaſon why any thing is true, as why it is falſe. And moſt men muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this: For how many of us have great and exalted conceptions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and things, till experience makes nearer and more ſtrict inſpections? Thus the Mountain <hi>Olympus,</hi> whoſe height is ſo extolled by the Poets,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:36404:127"/>and ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> that it is ſaid to exceed the Clouds, and lodge its top in the very Skies; is yet ſaid by <hi>Plutarch</hi> (in <hi>Aemilian</hi>) that, upon the meaſure of <hi>Xenagoras,</hi> it was but a mile, and an half, and about ſeventy paces perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular. So ſome men, that ſeparate from us, manage their devotion with ſo much zeal, and heat, and thick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with clouds about it, attended with ſuch a mournful tone, and direful expreſſions, that an unintereſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt, at the firſt, of neceſſity think, that though their moſt profound abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laid them on the ground, yet their voices, muſt reach the higheſt Heavens, and their earneſt, and moſt paſſionate, expreſſions could not, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, be ſtopt by the Clouds, but muſt dart themſelves clear through them, and aſcend above the <hi>Moon, Sun,</hi> and more lofty <hi>Stars,</hi> and lodge themſelves in the higheſt Heavens. Nay, they themſelves who, by rubbing, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, and other implements, have been advanced to this height of carrying, their ſouls out of their bodies, like the Heathen Enthuſiaſts, <hi>who divined in a fury,</hi> have cauſed other men to believe, that to be inſpired from above, which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:36404:128"/>takes its original from mens own indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and madneſs. Such things, being the fruits of a warm conſtitution, and the effects of an odd temperament in mens bodies, paſs frequently for the perfection of the mind; and an airy ſoul, when it breaths forth extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fancy, is ſuppoſed to be blown upon firſt by that, <hi>which bloweth where it liſteth;</hi> And yet this may be the fruits of paſſion, and the effects of an ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of body, that paſſes for the perfection of an inſpired mind; and many things are ſuppoſed to proceed from the communication of Spirits, which are nothing but a diſeaſe of the body; nay, oftentimes, the product, only, of craft and ſubtilty. This may imitate ſome primitive inſpired, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, worſhip, when the Prophets ſpake by turns, and others were to hold their tongues; But, though it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſome kind of worſhip to God, 'tis now no more than an unreaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And 'tis no wonder, that error, and falſhood, being fairly varniſhed with a ſhew of truth, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by many Proſelytes, who either will nor, or cannot, give themſelves time, and retirement to conſider, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:36404:128"/>ſearch diligently into cauſes, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. And this is too apparent, and troubleſom alſo to many men, who find theſe things much operating on the weaker Sex, who are uſually more guided by affection, than reaſon, <hi>and ſo are led captive to divers luſts.</hi> Yet that which cauſes error to be courted inſtead of truth, is ſome reſemblance it bears to it; becauſe it has (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> reports of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Fables) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſome faint and obſcure repreſentations of truth; and theſe things are very often promoted by a perſons education, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, and temperament of body, in which a ſoul is impriſoned, and lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; but, at laſt, breaks looſe by the ſtrength of the diſeaſe, through the pores of the body, and obtains an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual vehicle to carry it. We read of ſome in <hi>Tully,</hi> (<hi>de Divinat. lib.</hi> 1.) who affirmed, (and we need not go ſo far back for them) <hi>ad opinionem imperito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fict as eſſe religiones;</hi> That Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was fitted according to the opinions of thoſe that were unskilful, and not able to make inquiſition into the nature, and truth of things. But if ever there were the Being, and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:36404:129"/>of God ſo ſtated, as we conſent in here, and yet a worſhip given to that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as unſuitable to him, as it is almoſt poſſible, which impoſed a cheat upon mankind; Then (conſidering the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) the favourers pretend to be their conduct) an odd ſort of Diſſenters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, apparently practiſe it. Nay, their way of worſhip is ſuited to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the weaker, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, judgements; and this appears in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of the Proſelytes to it, who real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe what they profeſs, and their Religion is not weighed by their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For we find by experience, and more converſe than they were willing formerly to have with us, that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are wonderfully devoted to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and though their Husbands are prevailed upon to come to Church, the Wives are yet addicted to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle: But few men, who do not make ſecular intereſt their God, of any briskneſs and ſtrength of parts, embrace thoſe methods: Yet ſome there are, that permit themſelves to be bound hand, and foot, with their wives apron-ſtrings; or follow the paths and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Miſtreſs, or the cuſtom of their Trade, or the advantage of an
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:36404:129"/>Office, and the ſame Motives (when Religion is ſo low) will bring them back to Church again; or equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> And, truly, I have obſerved in my time, (though I wiſh not for the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again) that the numbers of Sexes, are extremely diſproportionable among them: Which has created ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but no aſtoniſhment. For I quickly found, that it had been the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the great Deceiver of mankind, to gain an intereſt in the weaker Sex; that he might the more eaſily entangle the ſtronger. Thus the old Serpent began with <hi>Eve,</hi> and proceeded afterwards by <hi>Miriam,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſtill perſiſted by the wife of <hi>Job:</hi> Nay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Revelation of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when his power, and craft, was eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and muſt abate; the <hi>Jews,</hi> by his inſtigation, ſtirred up the devout and honourable women, to expel <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> out of their Coaſts, (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.50.). Thus alſo <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that bewitching Father of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> accompliſhed his deſigns by the help of <hi>Helena; Montanus,</hi> by <hi>Maximil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> men, by their <hi>Pucelle de Dieu;</hi> and our <hi>Engliſh Anabaptiſts,</hi> by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:36404:130"/>their <hi>Maid of Kent.</hi> I mention not theſe things, to undervalue the glory of that Sex; although it may ſerve to abate their pride, and ſtop their mouths when they are troubleſom, and cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſince not only the ſin of man, but the propenſity and inclination to it, came, at firſt, by the means of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But I urge this, to abate our zeal and affection to ſuch a worſhip, in which the weaker ſort become the great Devotioniſts, and not to eſpouſe wayes of Religion, by the example of thoſe, whoſe airy thoughts will not ſettle long enough upon one object, to conſider it well: And, though this be not a ſufficient argument to conclude againſt the worſhip of thoſe, with whom we have now entered into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; yet, it is enough to raiſe ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make us inquiſitive about ſuch matters. But, if we approach nearer to the worſhip of our Diſſenters, we ſhall find their prayers, many times, to conſiſt of ſuch expreſſions, as are too often unworthy of the Deity; whilſt they aſſume too great familiarity with God, and the perſons that utter them, in their peoples behalf, are more bold with him, than a well bred perſon
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:36404:130"/>will pretend to, even among ſuch as are not much his ſuperiours. <hi>Cotta,</hi> in <hi>Tully,</hi> (<hi>De natur. Deor. lib.</hi> 3.) having ſeverely diſputed againſt the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman,</hi> Gods ſays: <hi>Omnis igitur talis, à philoſophiâ pellatur error; ut cum de diis immortalibus diſputemus, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus digna diis immortalibus.</hi> When we ſpeak of the Immortal Gods, let us ſpeak things worthy of them. The Heathen may here inſtruct the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or at leaſt, ſome that pretend to it, who in ſpight of confutation, would be accounted the beſt of that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; that bold expreſſions, uncouth clamours, and looſe, incoherent, and, many times, inſignificant ſentences, which are the effects of inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſudden inventions, and the <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> raptures of a nimble fancy, do not ſuit with the wiſdom and greatneſs of that God, to whom all our prayers are addreſſed; nor the reaſon and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of thoſe ſouls which he has cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in us, to render us capable of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him here with a rational devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the enjoyment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal communion with him hereafter.

'Tis true indeed, our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, by the Sacrifice of himſelf, has <hi>made us Kings and Prieſts to God, and reconciled us by his blood, who were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at enmity with him;</hi> But he has not made us independent; or united us ſo cloſely to him, as if there remained no diſtance or diſproportion betwixt us; although the <gap reason="foreign">

God has, through Chriſt, admitted us to Grace here, and promiſed us eternal Glory hereafter: But this favour is an argument to heighten our devotion, not to abate the external ſigns of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in our worſhip, nor to detract from that wonderful reverence ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſome preparative conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:36404:132"/>of Gods excellencies, which we have in our minds, and ought alwayes to accompany our prayers. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear,</hi> (ſayes <hi>David</hi>) nay, <hi>rejoyce alſo, before him, with trembling,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.) And can this agree with rude behaviour, and odd lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and brawling noiſes, which are frequently heard from wild Zealots, and <hi>extempore</hi> Devotioniſts, whilſt they are praying to an Almighty, Great, and Omnipotent Being? We find in <hi>Tully</hi> (<hi>de divin. lib.</hi> 1.) That the <hi>Romans,</hi> even in their Heathen worſhip, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the people, <hi>ut in rebus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, quae publicè fierent, faverent linguis.</hi> That in all publick Oblations to the Gods, they ſhould take care to keep awful ſilence; and not ſuffer noiſe to drown devotion, as if God were their familiar aſſociate. How diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then, muſt the prodigious braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and wild actions, and fantaſtick intermixtures of the higheſt elevations and loweſt cadencies of mens voices in continued prayer, be to the Majeſty of that Being, whom they, at the ſame time, pretend both to reverence and adore? Such deportment indeed, for men that have a deſign upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:36404:133"/>may ſuit and endear ſuch Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, as, without conſulting their underſtandings at all, may be pleaſed with ſuch percuſſions upon their Nerves, and make them juſt ready for a battel: It may well enough ſuit with the hidden deſigns of aſpiring men, who would advance themſelves, in the conceipt of the multitude, to the wiſdom and renown of immortal Gods, and then exhibit their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Thunder and Lightning, to frighten the people into a ſtricter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: and therefore may proclaim the ſubtilty of thoſe, who love Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when 'tis uſhered in by Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and are of no Religion, but ſuch as is introduced by force of Arms. This was a ſucceſsful way of enterprize to thoſe that knock'd down a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with the butt end of what was falſe; and, as if they had been Gods, they thundered firſt with Powder and Bullet, before they gave forth their Laws, and did not publiſh them to the people, till they were written with the points of their Swords dipp'd in blood. But however ſuch things might advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage a Cauſe, that could not be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but in a ſtrange and new habit of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:36404:133"/>Religion; yet certain it is, that a rude and boiſterous worſhipping of the Deity, can no way comport with the humility of thoſe, who know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt their Maker and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are deſirous to fear him here, that ſo they may enjoy him hereafter. And can any thing be more inconſiſtent with right reaſon, than willingly to admit the publick Offices of the Desk and Pulpit, to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a more idle and confident deportment, than the lighteſt and moſt ridiculous actions of a Stage? To ſee a man, who pretends to incline God by his petitions to favour him, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men by his arguments and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to command the one, or hector the other, will cauſe the ſpectator eaſily to conclude, that his paſſion will ſooner diſturb himſelf, than his prayer or reaſon perſwade another. 'Tis true, indeed, that ſuch wild deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and imperious language to ſome perſons, apt to be frightned with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant behaviour, or loud noiſes, may prove a method fit to make ſome ſtrange impreſſions; and the ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a mournful complexion, or an affected tone, with phraſes uttered, that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:36404:134"/>make a grateful percuſſion on the Nerves of thoſe, who, having melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly conſtitutions, are of mournful aſpects, may appear pleaſant, though it heightens their diſtemper. And others may conclude a boiſterous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, when it is accompanied with ſtrong lungs, to be the fruits of a well managed zeal, and great ſigns of grace and devotion: yet all this may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deſign; becauſe God may appear in a <hi>ſtill voice,</hi> as well as in <hi>thunder and lightning:</hi> and amongſt men of all perſwaſions, there are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, and mimical, repreſentations of theſe things. Nay, Satan himſelf, who, for his own ends, can play the Ape, by way of imitation, in divine affairs, can be as potent in a Foxes caſe to deceive the ſimple, as he is formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in a Lyons skin, to terrifie thoſe that are more ſtout and daring: And certain it is, that he deceives more dangerouſly, under the Fleece of a ſilly Lamb, than when he ſpreads the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of an Oſpray: and we ought to have the greater caution, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears like an Angel of light, than when he becomes viſible by his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection. The worſt men may, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:36404:134"/>be the moſt ſevere reprovers of Sin and Vice, who yet deſign nothing leſs than amendment in themſelves: As that wicked Spirit, who wrought wonders by <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> that blaſphemous <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> was, in appearance, ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he would frequently rebuke open faults, <hi>ut videretur corrector viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,</hi> that he might ſeem to be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of vices. But, as for thoſe drail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tones, and long tail'd expreſſions, which are ſo bewitching to mournful tempers; They being, uſually, either the effects of craft, or the products of melancholy diſpoſitions, though vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly deem'd the gifts of God, and fruits growing from the operation of the Spirit; Yet there cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy to the main Doctrines, and practice of Chriſtianity, nor to the peace of men, profeſſing that Religion, than a dull and melancholy temper of mind. For this is as formidable an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to our Religion, as it was in <hi>Judea,</hi> to the gift of Prophecy; and ſo much did it interfere with that there, as to cauſe even a proverbial Speech; That the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> never reſides in a ſorrowful man. Beſides, in all theſe things, which, if we retire, become
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:36404:135"/>the objects of our ſenſes, a good humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt may as well act as they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the moſt magnified inſpiration. And as the <hi>Swan</hi> was never uſed in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law; So will an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite (though he is never ſo ſubtil) be rejected by God, in the ſervice of the Goſpel; Becauſe, like the <hi>Swan,</hi> under the white plumes, and pleaſant voice, their lies hidden a black Skin. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, the Hypocrite, in a ſeeming Zeal, and Devotion, may frequently exceed, in external ſweat, and geſture too, him that is moſt ſerious and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in his prayers; Though, when we ſee ſo much ſmoke, we eaſily perceive that the flame does not aſcend. For although art may vye with nature it ſelf, and the cunning Hypocrite, who trades in Religion, may enable himſelf, or his cuſtomers may inform him, how he may outdo the rational acts of true devotion, ſo as to entrap the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; yet in this the cheat will be plainly diſcovered, and his deſign will be written in open characters on the matter he utters, with a fervency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the modeſty of devotion; and appear alſo to the moſt vulgar eye, if the head in which it is fix'd, is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

                  <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was diſcerned to be no right <hi>Athenian,</hi> even by a plain and ſimple woman of the City, becauſe the great care he had in the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his words, cauſed her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he affected, only, but had not, the proper phraſe, and accents, of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> And, indeed, unleſs extempore men worſhip one God, and we another, it will not be either a formal head, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly adorned, nor a grave aſpect, nor either hard or ſoft expreſſions, although attended with an affected tone,; No, nor Zeal tranſported into Frenzy, and madneſs, nor all the effects of ſubtilty, or art, or the eaſie endowments even of nature it ſelf, that can be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our prayers to that God, <hi>who ſearcheth the hearts, and trieth the reins of the children of men;</hi> for he (if we have true notions of him) loves an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and good mind, beyond either the complements of the Formaliſt, or the cheats of the Hypocrite; we know that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were excellent ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the outſide of themſelves, and very prying into the inſide of others; that they could make clean the outſide of the cup and of the platter, when yet their own inward parts, were full of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:36404:136"/>ravening, and all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Theſe could be very preciſe, and ſtrict in ſmaller matters, to the <hi>paying tyth of mint, and rue, and all manner of herbs; but paſſed over judgement, and the love of God,</hi> (Luke 11.). And the Epicures, notwithſtanding the luxury, and irregularity of their lives, could ſpeak of God, in the publick Schools of <hi>Athens,</hi> with greater reverence than any other Sect of Philoſophers: And yet we find in <hi>Tully,</hi> at the latter end of his firſt Book, <hi>de Naturâ Deorum,</hi> that, <hi>Epicurus retollit, oratione relinquit Deos:</hi> That he could allow thoſe Gods in his Speeches, which, in reality, he denied. And, whilſt there is ſuch a thing as falſhood in the world, and men may make profeſſion with their tongues, of what their minds do not heartily aſſent to; There can be no certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible judgement made from wordy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, or external geſtures, nor yet from ſeeming tranſports of devotion. <hi>Tacitus</hi> informs us, that the Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in <hi>Galba</hi>'s time, <hi>triſtitiam ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant propiores contumaciae.</hi> That they counterfeited ſorrow, when their minds were ſtubborn: And although many men, among our ſelves, may
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:36404:136"/>have ſteady brows, and fixed eyes, and walk with a grave and upright de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; yet privacy may diſcover to one who obſervantly converſes with them, that they are either empty, or elſe frothy and vain. Far too many are guilty of that fault, which <hi>Cicero</hi> pretends againſt <hi>Verres. Frontem atque oculos mentiri.</hi> Their foreheads, and their eyes, ſpeak falſhoods. Boldneſs is a common ſhelter to theſe things; and confidence is almoſt characteriſtical to thoſe that are adverſaries to our Church prayers, ſo great, and large, that 'tis a rare thing to find modeſty enough to hold the tongues of thoſe, who have been apparently baffled; much leſs, to make their faces bluſh, when their hands were all ſmeer'd with blood, nay, ſo much as to aſcend to the Throne with Swords, and Staves; (not to mention what they took thence, and moſt barbarouſly but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered); and, after all, an <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> is perpetually ſent out after their repentance, and yet they hide it, that it cannot be found. But inſtead of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of their own guilt; they will, in deſpight of the experience of mankind, averr their piety to exceed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:36404:137"/>the Religion of other men, and from their fondneſs to themſelves, infer the kindneſs of God to them. Like that bloody and cruel Tyrant <hi>Domitian,</hi> who painted <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Market place, with pleaſant colours, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his boſom, though he ſhould have been repreſented trodden under his feet. <hi>Strabo,</hi> indeed, tells us, that it is impoſſible to perſuade women, and the promiſcuous multitude, to Religion, by mere reaſon, and dry Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, but that for this, there is need of Superſtition, and this cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced without Fables, and Wonders, (<hi>Geor. lib.</hi> 1.) Yet the great God, whom all Chriſtians pretend to adore, never uſhered in his Religion into the World, but by ſuch Miracles as were real, and true: But when ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as ours is, becomes planted, and ſufficiently by Miracles, (beyond all the abilities of natural Cauſes, that we are acquainted with) proved to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; the rational account that may be given of it, (it no wiſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting natural Religion) will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inforce its eſteem, and exerciſe, without the addition of any new jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles or devices of our own. And
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:36404:137"/>therefore, the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they embraced, though falſe in its ſelf, might neither ſuffer by flattery, or fraud, when the <hi>Soothſayers</hi> increaſed ſo faſt in their City, made an Order of Senate, that none but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſhould practiſe theſe matters, left ſo exalted, and Divine an art, ſhould be degraded from the Majeſty of Religion, to a baſer trade of fraud, and couſenage, (As <hi>Tully</hi> tells us in his firſt Book of <hi>Divinat.</hi>) And indeed it holds good, and rational, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a true Religion, more than it could poſſibly under a falſe; For where, as in the daies of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is formed out of the meaneſt of the people, they will not ſcruple to carry wiſps of Hay, to feed Calves at <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> But farther, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, we now find Secular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt a moſt prevailing principle in the minds of men; and therefore is it, that, upon a late, and more particular, ſcrutiny, we find mens particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſtoop to their own perſonal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and the rites and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they ought to exerciſe in the true profeſſion, to be countermanded, when injoyn'd by lawful Authority,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:36404:138"/>by the profit which attends mens par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Trades, and occupations: As if becauſe <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and others, made ſilver Shrines for <hi>Diana,</hi> it muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be concluded, <hi>that great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> This is the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why our Sectaries are like the Aſtrologers at <hi>Rome,</hi> always baniſhed, and yet ever here: For intereſt, and advantage, quickly turn prudence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubtilty, and this as ſoon will erect a fortreſs to defend it ſelf, if it does not, alſo, expel honeſty out of its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Nay, this private intereſt of Honour, and Wealth, too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rules abundance of men in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws, ſubmitting to them, and executing them too, even againſt all right, and publick advantage. This we find to have been formerly at <hi>Rome;</hi> For though there was ſufficient and notorious evidence, that the Books, found by <hi>Petilius</hi> in <hi>Numa</hi>'s grave, were certainly his; Yet becauſe they were adjudged, by the Senate, to be contrary to the preſent cuſtoms and Laws of the City, and conſequently might tell tales, and make diſcoveries, and lay that common, which was then incloſed; they were, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:36404:138"/>enquiry, ſentenced to be burnt. And thus we may, without uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, ſuppoſe that many deal with Religion: Though they are convinced, (or elſe, dreading the evidence, will not have patience to attend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of an argument,) that what our Church profeſſes, and injoins, is naked truth; Yet becauſe either its embracement, or defence, may at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or ſucceeding times, lay them open to ſome temporal troubles, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, they will neither be honeſt to God, nor <hi>Baal;</hi> but trim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, keeping their own Boat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, let the tide, and the waves, beat which way they will; And by another Metaphor, cut with whiskers, or ſhave all off; and either they halt betwixt two Opinions, or if they profeſs one, they will leave it when a ſtorm ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and follow our bleſſed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, only, whilſt the loaves laſt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert him, if he once wants bread. In an inſtance hinted at a little before, when Idolatry was like to fall at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> (and then the Images could not ſtand) by the powerful Preaching of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> the people began to entertain an opinion, <hi>that they were no gods, which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:36404:139"/>were made with hands:</hi> But at laſt, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> a City Orator, (and, for ought I know, Maſter of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) aſſembled all his Crafts-men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and informs them that their livelihood would be in danger, and their trade ſet at nought, if ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as Chriſtianity ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent among them: As ſoon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as they underſtood that, in the concernment of their Religion, their trade was involved, by which they were to make out their fortunes in this World; and that the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> was that which ſupported them; they quickly gave a check to their own he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations in matter of Religion; the grandeur of <hi>Diana</hi> was preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; they grew full of wrath for what they had a favourable opinion of, and cried out, with the largeſt throat they could make, even for the full ſpace of two hours, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 19.). So won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully prevalent is the ſence of gain as if it were the only godlineſs) for, or againſt, any Religion in the World, among men who only value the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Serpent, but do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the innocence of the Dove. And
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:36404:139"/>now, upon the view of this, can any of us ſecure our ſelves, that they who are enemies to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whatever friendſhip there may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, do not ſhare in this thing? Can we conclude, that they exalt not Schiſm for wealth, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Or, upon any equilibrious or probable arguments, ſo much as hope that they adhere to a party, where all profeſs the ſame faith, without ſome reſpects and deſigns that are far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Chriſtian Religion, and Proteſtant intereſt? If not; Then, amongſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, that bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Pope, and much more in thoſe who are not ſo much as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at large, 'tis neither the external deportments of men, their fluency of language, nor any of their ſeeming zeal, or raptures, that can evidence to us that their worſhip is ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the glory or greatneſs of the Deity, or agreeable to the reaſon of mankind; ſince gain will force men to appear godly in ſpight of all our teeth; and though they are bit never ſo ſeverely, if they pleaſe, they will run on ſtill, till ye do not only catch them, but hold them faſt.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:36404:140"/>
               <p>But let us leave the ſhell, and pick out the kernel; If we can find any in ſuch a Controverſie as this, and a Maggot is not got into the Nut: Let us travel from the Porch to the Temple, and view both their Sacrifice, and Altar, (if that word be not prophane) and ſee well whether the fire heats parallel to the blaze it makes among them. Let us look into the Modes, by which our Brethren-adverſaries make their addreſſes to Almighty God, and judge whether their prayers, or deportment is ſuitable to that reſpect which, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn invocations, is rationally due to the Divine Majeſty, and that infinite Being, whom Chriſtian men pretend to adore?</p>
               <p>The uſual way of the Native Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of <hi>England,</hi> who Diſſent from the Liturgy, and Church Eſtabliſhed in this Nation by Law, among us, is to pray to God without premeditation, in relation unto words, and, as ſome affirm, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too, expecting, in this, aſſiſtances from the Spirit of God, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their rational faculties, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal helps, (though 'tis no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in this ſence) and ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ponder before-hand, what is ſitting
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:36404:140"/>to be offered to their Maker. Now can it poſſibly be conſiſtent with the greatneſs of that power, which diſpoſes and confers the Crowns, and Scepters, of this lower World, to admit ſuch addreſſes, which muſt be indigeſted, and therefore rude? If theſe men, themſelves, were to petition any Earthly Prince, for either a pardon, or place of advantage, they would very well conſider both the matter, and the form; that neither inconvenience, or abſurdity, might be mixed with the one, nor rudeneſs, or too much famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, enter into the compoſition of the other: Nay, whoſoever are choſen to preſent it, are uſually perſons, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of integrity, but prudence too; not only ſuch as may be acceptable to the Prince, but they who have a deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuitable to Majeſty; that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves with ſuch humility, and lowlineſs, accompanied with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent deſire; not only to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the grievance of the petitioners, but their affection too, ſignifying the teſtimonies of the ſeriouſneſs of their minds, by the external gravity, and ſubmiſſion expreſſed in the geſtures, and actions, of their bodies. And can
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:36404:141"/>any think that the great God, when we make Religious addreſſes to him, can be well pleas'd with what we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count an affront to men, ſince he is a rational, living, and infinite Being? 'Tis true, indeed, we have found ſome in the world, who anciently worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Mercury</hi> by railing, and <hi>Hercules,</hi> by throwing ſtones at him: But ſurely, the God whom Chriſtians pretend to ſerve, is neither deaf, that he cannot hear, nor, becauſe he is ſtrong, is he become inſenſible. Reverence, and a moſt awful fear, are ſuitable ornaments for him to wear, who pretends to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Almighty, to adore him; for he is able to blaſt us in a moment, and deſtroy us with a word, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abroad duſt and aſhes, with the breath of his noſtrils; and can, when he pleaſes, cauſe an haſty word uttered before him, to choak the perſon who is bold to ſpeak it; nay, without point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arrow backward, cauſe either it ſelf to periſh upon the ſtring, or him that is ſhooting it, to drop down dead before him: And is this God, with a ruder confidence, to be addreſs'd to? The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Gods were figured with their fingers in their months, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:36404:141"/>awe, and forbid clamours, to thoſe who came nigh to worſhip them: And ſhall the true, ſenſible, and living Being, who is infinite in all glorious perfections, be more confidently dealt with, by thoſe, who pretend to a pure worſhip, than the deportment of men durſt teſtifie before thoſe, who indeed were no Gods? Shall the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon of men, in a land of darkneſs, give rules to render devotion ſtrict; and no limits be impoſed to the rudeneſs of Gods creatures, in a land of light? When a ſociety of men agree together to deſire any boon, or favour, from one that is their ſuperiour on Earth; how cautious are they in word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Addreſs? How do they chuſe ſuch, as they are able to confide in, to draw it up? With what a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſeriouſneſs, and grave conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is it afterwards review'd by the whole body? How ſtrict are they in the moſt minute circumſtances? And, when they have paſſed it through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objections, and amendments; how choice are they in pitching upon one, that has a good tongue, a quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and is moſt powerful both in Argument, and Rhetorick, to preſent
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:36404:142"/>it in writing; and, if need be, to ſpeak in relation to the heads of it? And ſhall the great God of all the World, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to whom the talleſt Cedars are but ſhrubs; who can drive all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind before him, like duſt before a ſtorm; who can cauſe Kings, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors too, to vail their Crowns, and lay their Scepters at his feet: Shall this infinite Majeſty be addreſs'd to ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, and inconſiderately, as if he were our familiar Companion? Cannot he diſcharge the Artillery of Heaven, and cauſe his Lightning to conſume the World, or the voice of his Thunder, to make us afraid? Is not he able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call our breath in as ſhort a moment, as that, in which he firſt gave us life, and make us a prey to rottenneſs, and Vermin? The great Maker, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the World, is not, certainly, ſo ſmall a thing, as the haſty and rude devotions of ſome men might cauſe others to believe that he is. Nay, that we may not conjecture, that becauſe he needs not adoration, and homage from any, even his moſt rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; becauſe he wants nothing to render him eternally happy, neither the outward reſpect of the bodies of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:36404:142"/>men, nor their internal acts of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and devotion, to make additions to his own glory, he neither regards the one, nor minds the other: See himſelf atteſting his own Dignity, and declaring what he expects from thoſe, who being the workmanſhip of his hands, he has cauſed, by his favour, to become related to him; and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe Prieſts, that were too bold either with himſelf, or ſuch things, as were dedicated to his Service. <hi>A Son</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter; If then I am a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where is mine honour, and if I be a Maſter, where is my fear, unto you O Prieſts that deſpiſe my name?</hi> And when they confidently ask, <hi>wherein have we deſpiſed it?</hi> His anſwer is; <hi>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and ſay, that the Table of the Lord is contemptible; And for that they offered the blind, and the ſick, and the lame; Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it now</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>to thy Governour; will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon?</hi> (firſt Chap. of <hi>Malac.</hi>) <hi>That lofty one who inhabiteth Eternity,</hi> whoſe we are, and whom we ſerve, will not accept of ſuch ſervices to himſelf, as are not worthy enough to be given to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:36404:143"/>men. And how, indeed, is it poſſible that he can, either in juſtice, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor? Unleſs he ſhould relax the, reins of Government, and caſt things into, an eternal confuſion, by a voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from his own Glory, which yet, he has reſolved not to give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, yet, omitting other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if our own reaſon, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd from paſſion, will conclude that we ought to pay deference to others, either diſtinct from, or of the ſame natures, with our ſelves, ſuitable to that dignity they obtain in the univerſe, or the ſeveral degrees that ſome of our own ſpecies are juſtly advanced and exalted to, by any regular and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded motion; and if we are, when we depart not from our own Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, obliged to be cautious in our-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to other men, rendring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to whom honour is due; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if we have a true notion of the Deity; and that the God whom we worſhip, is ſelf-exiſtent, and includes all poſſible perfection; There is much more reaſon, that we ſhould be very circumſpect about the actions, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which we devote to him. The Apoſtle informs us, that the worſhip
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:36404:143"/>that is expected under the Goſpel, muſt be ſuch as comports with the principles of right reaſon; and therefore he does exhort, when he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and beſeech the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he might have Canonically injoin'd them: <hi>I beſeech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reaſonable Service,</hi> (Rom. 12.1.). And as he draws an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſuch an invitation from the mercies of God, in this place; So he infers, in another, <hi>from the price of our redemption, that we muſt glorifie God in our bodies, and our Spirits, which are his.</hi> (1 Cor. 6.20). And, ſince both were Created, and Redeemed by him, 'tis but equal, that he ſhould have the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of both; And, becauſe we, with faith, and hope, expect that future Glory, ſhould as well reward our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as our Souls; it is but reaſonable, that both ſhould join in the diſcharge of thoſe duties, which our Creator, and Redeemer too, has commanded for us; not only as teſtimonies of our gratitude for all; but as conditions too, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie us for the poſſeſſions of Eternal life, and prepare us both to enjoy, and reliſh
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:36404:144"/>the Glorious and everlaſting refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above, which are only, to be had in ſuch a gracious, and tranſporting preſence, as the great God, in his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trinity makes, accompanied with his trains of Angels, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect.</p>

               <p>NOw, from all the foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large, we may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, or ſeverity, charge our Brethren, who, upon the falſe pretence of greater Reformation, ſeparate from us, and become our Adverſaries, with theſe following particulars, in which they are either defective in, or over-do thoſe rational and Divine acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God, which, diſcharging our Tribute, and Homage to him, <hi>become a ſervice acceptable, and well pleaſing;</hi> Whilſt in the mean time theſe wilful, or at leaſt ignorant, Separatiſts pretend ſtill, with the greateſt confidence, to be the beſt, if not the only, <hi>worfhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in Spirit, and in truth:</hi> But this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is vain and fond.</p>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>(Firſt,)</hi> They uſually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate what the great God has joined, and accepts, together; Nor do they worſhip him (or at leaſt they account it not neceſſary) <hi>with their outward man,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:36404:145"/>as well as with the hidden man of the heart.</hi> 'Tis true, indeed, bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship profiteth little, yet ſomething it does; but nothing at all, when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd from the intention and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind; becauſe it is a perfect demonſtration of Hypocriſie, which is very odious both to God, and man: But yet, men cannot well pretend the devotion of their minds, (eſpecially ſo as to convince others) when it is not accompanied with humble and ſuitable deportments of their bodies. For, if there were no regard to be had to mens bodily geſtures, when they pretend to pay homage, and worſhip to God; then if we argue like men that have reaſonable ſouls given them, to diſcern betwixt good, and evil, it muſt be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Maker, knowing the deſigns of our hearts, does not expect external demonſtrations, of what he concludes to be lodged within us: But then we need no other pains to addreſs our ſelves, but only to raiſe our conceptions to the ſtrongeſt, and moſt fixed thoughts; nimble apprehenſions would be enough to compoſe a prayer, and it would be utterance ſufficient, if we did but only temper our lips?
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:36404:145"/>cough, and raiſeflegm into our throats, nay, without any action of our bodies at all, if our prayer were compoſed, or rather intended within our ſelves, without the delivery of our own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any ſignification of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of our hearts, by the language of our tongues: And, if this were right, Women themſelves might bring forth too, without any travail, or pains to them, if they could but keep their own counſel. But, alas! ſuch notions as theſe, in thoſe prayers which are in common, do not ſignifie ſo much as a man that gapes, when he ought to ſpeak. For even words in prayer, ſerve only to utter our minds, and are no more than an external ſign, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of what we had, before, inwardly conceived; And ſince this is by all men, of ſence, accounted to be a ſervice acceptable to God, why may he not receive the ſignatures, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our ſouls, by any other corporal demonſtration? Why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the lifting up of our hands to our mouths, and kiſſing them, as in old time, be proper adoration? Why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inclining our heads, or bowing our bodies, ſtill continue to be a certain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:36404:146"/>of reverence, and ſubmiſſion, and of worſhip too? Why cannot kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or proſtration upon the ground, Religiouſly ſignifie, the humility, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and the moſt profound lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our minds? Eſpecially, ſince 'tis as old as <hi>David to worſhip, and fall down, and to kneel alſo before the Lord our Maker.</hi> But if ſuch reaſoning may not be admitted by thoſe, who account all reaſon carnal, from the experience of their own, eſpecially when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts themſelves; If men can at all be, brought to themſelves; nay, but ſo far as not to think, that <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, has not beaten out the brains of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: If we approvedly uſe words in our devotions to God, although he knows our conceived petitions, when no expreſſions are uttered by our mouths, diſcerning our thoughts a far off; Nor do I deſire, that even this plain poſition, may be precarious, or granted by Adverſaries without proof, ſince if they will but yield God to be a Spirit, they may eaſily conjecture that he can be more quickly ſenſible of the thoughts of our ſouls, (eſpecially if they account him to be infinite too) by a certain near and prying intuition, the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:36404:146"/>mode of which is not ſo adapted to our apprehenſions; than having not the organs of ſenſe, by which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and expreſs things, he can be ſaid, in a literal ſence, to hear our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But, for all this, in publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we, having others to join with us, as we uſe words to ſignifie our petitions, which expreſs the ſentiments of our minds; So do we alſo by habits, and geſtures, repreſent our devotions, and conceptions to others, to raiſe their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in proportion to our own, that they, by all means poſſible, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what we are about, may be inclined to aſſent, and ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and be prevailed on to frame themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame reſemblance of mind, and body, that there may not only be an unity in our common worſhip, but Uniformity too. And if theſe other ſigns, beſides words, in the poſtures of our bodies, or both in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may effectually conduce to the ſame end, which is the raiſing, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying our devotion; I ſee no reaſon why the actions of other members of our bodies, beſides the articulate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our tongues, that notoriouſly declare profound humility, and preſent
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:36404:147"/>our devotions, and ſignifie in the eyes of all the world, (unleſs it be to thoſe, who are reſolved to ſhut them in their prayers, to avoid the Argument) our homage to, and dependance on, God, ſhould not be uſed, in worſhipping our Maker, as well as words, which an abſolute neceſſity of underſtanding one another, has improved, and made co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious by cuſtom, and art, and a long time ſince were rendered faſhionable in the world, as being more ready than other ſigns, and repreſentations from any different members of the body; For theſe are alſo the action, and labour of the tongue, and lips. It will appear to all men that) in prayer, and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the body ought to accompany the mind; they being ſuch intimate and united friends, that both make but one man; becauſe any that in private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to God, when they are in different appartments from one another, and when they enter into their Cloſets, and are ſtill, if they pray with any earneſtneſs, and affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved to it, by the conſideration of that great God, to whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, their own meanneſs when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him, or the abſolute neceſſity
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:36404:147"/>of obtaining thoſe things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for, they expreſs their minds with ſuch ſervor, and humility, as affect their bodies, and caſt them into poſtures, that cuſtomarily ſignifie, and repreſent theſe things to other men. However, methinks, they who, diſſenting from the Service of our Church, are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be the mouth of others, ought, in juſtice, to declaim for the worſhip of mens bodies, ſince, commonly, the motions and activity of their bodies in all, even their publick, devotions, is that which more recommends them to their people, than the ſenſe of their petitions, or the decency of the words, by which they expreſs it. But let us argue this thing fairly with our ſelves; and then can any man, who has ſtript himſelf of prejudice, and prepoſſeſſions in his enquiries about the worſhip of his Maker, do otherwiſe than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we nearer arrive at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that homage due to him, by how much the more we employ our bodies in decent expreſſions of gravity, humility, and apt affection, to declare the inward intention of our minds, which are full of all vigor, and fervent deſire, and the moſt awful thoughts
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:36404:148"/>of that great Majeſty whom we adore? For this deportment gives to God a whole Sacrifice; when others, who, in their prayers, only hide their minds in their bodies, as if they were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the Heathen Gods, to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, and ſtiff Statue; ſeparating the inward actions of their ſouls, from any correſpondent geſtures of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if they worſhip God at all, (which they ſeem not very fond to declare): Yet they devote only half of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and honor him in ſuch a manner as other men can neither ſee nor know, unleſs, men had Caſements in their Breaſts, that being opened, others might look into them. But that the worſhip of mens bodies ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the devotions of their minds, is ſo apparent from Gods Injunctions under the Law, that it cannot admit of any contradiction: And if we argue for it, under the eſtabliſhment in the Goſpel, from thoſe Commands we ſind in the Law, we have nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but that the <hi>Jews</hi> were a dull and ſtupid people, in compariſon to our ſelves; and men thus boaſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having much cauſe of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. For, notwithſtanding all the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:36404:148"/>Invectives we have heard againſt the pitiful carnality and dulneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it appears too often, to our great loſs, that they are as witty and more cunning than our ſelves: We, indeed, having received helps and advantages by the Goſpel, and a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of Chriſt, in whom they refuſed to believe, are better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the methods of a more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Religion, than they could be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. But, yet, what was then eſtabliſhed, which reaſon inforced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to the natures of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that was never yet repeated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, nor ever can; I may confidently affirm, may remain ſtill without any check or controll for uſing it. And therefore I cannot come to any damage in affirming, that the worſhip of mens bodies, in all their publick addreſſes unto God, ought to accompany that of their minds, till better arguments are brought againſt it, than any which I have yet heard or ſeen, 'Tis true, indeed, our Saviour acquaints the woman of <hi>Samaria, that the hour cometh, and now is, when thoſe who are of the true Chriſtian Church ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:36404:149"/>becauſe he ſeeks ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> (<hi>John.</hi> 4.23.) Yet all this, though when 'tis interpreted according to the opinions of ſome men, makes others ſtagger, that are ſo weak, as to deſert their reaſon, that they may become wiſe, and go out of themſelves to poſſeſs; their ſouls; and forſake the conduct of their own underſtandings, guided by the rules of Gods Word, that they may be frighted into the follies of others. All this, I ſay, may, when juſtly enlarged on, rebuke Schiſm, or Idolatry, or falſe worſhip: But this Text cannot authorize any detraction from external decency in the ſervice of God, nor abate from thoſe orderly Rites and Ceremonies, that promote Uniformity in the worſhip of him, or tend to the ſixation and eſtabliſhment of true Religion, under the Goſpel; nor ſuch circumſtances of devotion which are not in particular, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly aboliſhed by the Meſſiah, having been before Types and Prefigurations of him to come. If any of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worſhip of our bodies were of this kind which is injoyned by our Chriſtian Superiors, our practice would contradict our faith, and deny Chriſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:36404:149"/>to be come in the fleſh, and juſtifie the <hi>Jews</hi> in the expectation of a Meſſiah. But, the truth is, the conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Saviour, and the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> is ſo far from prohibiting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places of worſhip, or external ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of our bodies in devotion adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the inward reverence of our minds; that it eſtabliſhes a ſpiritual, rational, and Evangelical worſhip, in oppoſition to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Schiſm, and Idolatry too and briefly declares, that the Chriſtian Religion was now to be eſtabliſhed, to aboliſh all other that were in the world, that mankind being united in one faith and hope, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting in one common principle, and worſhipping God through the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Redeemer, having lived in this world, with true devotion to the God that made them, and in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace among themſelves, might at laſt dye with comfort within their own breaſts, and then enter into the joy of their Lord. But if all this were largely controverted to a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what ſhall we think of that Text of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he delivers points of a moral and perpetual eſtabliſhment, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:36404:150"/>of an univerſal concernment to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Keep thy foot when thou comeſt into the Sanctuary of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> It was an uſual cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the faſhion of thoſe Eaſtern Countreys, to ſignifie their reverence in a ſacred place, by putting off their Sandals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entered, that they might not prophane, or, which is all one, render common, by a defilement, an holy place; or what was ſeparated from vulgar uſe, to ſuch as was ſacred, and related unto God. From whence, with reference to the reaſon of the thing, was that Injunction, more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than this Text, <hi>Pull off thy ſhoos from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground,</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5.) The place being, before, mean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; a toft of ground, on which buſhes grew; yet becauſe God conſecrated it by his own preſence, making it holy for Divine Offices, to give <hi>Moſes</hi> his Commiſſion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Law; therefore the ſigns of reverence were to be uſed there, and external demonſtrations of devotion to be exhibited. Now this particular action, of making bare the feet, being
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:36404:150"/>an outward teſtimony of reſpect in thoſe Countreys where this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; it ſufficiently inſtructs all ſubſequent poſterities of men, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſigns of humility and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, muſt be given in the ſervice of the Deity, eſpecially ſuch, in which we pretend, to converſe with him; and in thoſe places that are devoted to his honour. And ſince divers Countreys uſe diſtinct modes of reverence and reſpect, according to their cuſtomary ſignification and acceptance; as the inhabitants of <hi>Japan</hi> ſalute, by pulling off the Shoo, when we do the ſame by pulling off our Hats, and uncovering our Heads; we may therefore fairly conclude, that if <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Text, had ſpoken to perſons uſed to our Cuſtoms, and ſubject to the Conſtitutions of our Nation; he would have ſaid, <hi>Pull off thy Hat when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the ſacrifice of fools: for they conſider not, that they do evil.</hi> And then the inference from this will be, That we ought, in all places, dedicated to God, on which his Name and Honour are inſcribed, where we pretend to offer our Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:36404:151"/>to teſtifie the inward devotion of our minds, by the outward behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and deportment of our bodies. And this will juſtifie the bowing our Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks, by a reverent inclination, the bending our Knees, or an erected po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of our bodies, when our ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and prayers may require the one, or our praiſes the other. Thus when <hi>Ezra</hi> had mourned for that affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which the <hi>Jews</hi> had contracted with Strangers, by mingling Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage with the people of the Land, contrary to the Injunctions of him who was their Divine King, and Supreme Legiſlator, he not only <hi>rended his own garment, and tore his mantle, and pluck'd off the hair of his head,</hi> to repreſent the ſorrow and lamentation of his mind, by ſuch outward ſignatures and actions of his body; but the guilt, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which he might fear would attend it, cauſed him to <hi>fall down upon his knees, and ſpread out his hands unto the Lord his God,</hi> (<hi>Ezra</hi> 9.5.) Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, ſymbolical, and ſignificant actions of his body, accompanied the lowly humility of his mind, when he made his afflicting confeſſion to his Maker. Thus we find, alſo, that when
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:36404:151"/>the moſt impious and prophane Decree was ſigned by <hi>Darius,</hi> as full of cruelty, as it was of irreligion, <hi>That whoſoever asked any petition from God or man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only from this King himſelf, for the ſpace of thirty dayes, he ſhould be caſt into the Den of Lions: Daniel,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>fell upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks to his God, as he did before the decree was paſs'd,</hi> (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.) Nay, we have not only Old Teſtament examples for joyning the worſhip of our bodies with our ſouls, and by outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſignifying the inward devotion of our minds: but we find in the New Teſtament too (beſides our Saviours kneelings, proſtrations, and lifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with other Canonical patterns, before, in this Diſcourſe) that S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he prayed, that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might have courage and ſtrength to perſevere in the profeſſion, and hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick duties, of Chriſtianity, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the threats, and perſecutions, of their adverſaries, <hi>bowed his knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14.) He might, ſurely, have petitioned God for the ſame bleſſings,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:36404:152"/>when, for ought we know, he was in private, by himſelf, without any ſuch external ceremony, which ſome men ſo diſregard in publick, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which our deportment has on others, becomes the great argument for its neceſſity. But nature it ſelf would have provoked him to this; which men forſake, when they bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to ſuch outward teſtimonies of reſpect: As if God, becauſe he has no bodily eyes, can neither ſee nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. But who is the man that is truly devout, and does not chuſe his Religion, as it beſt ſuits with his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantages, that can look upon the Levites under the Law, ſtanding up to bleſs the Lord their God, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon others, to put themſelves into the ſame decency of poſture, and when all were uniform, crying out, with a loud voice, <hi>Bleſſed be thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name, which is exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe,</hi> (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.5.); and yet, under the larger bleſſings of the Goſpel, fit faſt, and refuſe to ſtand up at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> and other Hymns of the Chriſtian Church; or who could have ſeen the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans laying upon the floor, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:36404:152"/>their breaſts, and faſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt into Skeletons, wanting little more to diſſolve their bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duſt and aſhes, and yet, obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that their zeal tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them beyond their knowledge; and that groans and ſighs might more compendiouſly have expreſſed their ſorrow and repentance: And that 'tis better, now, to have no external de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations at all? But I ſhall not purſue ſuch arguments any farther; nor any men, with whom no reaſon can prevail; who ſeem to take ſuch great care for the eaſe of their bodies, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pains their ſouls muſt at laſt endure. From what has been ſaid, it will readily be inferr'd, by all who are inclin'd to piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when we meet with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who pretend to worſhip the Great, and only Supreme, God, and yet deny the ſigns of reverence and due reſpect ſo univerſally paid by all ſerious and religious men, we may well conclude, that they do not perform their ſervice and homage with ſuch humility and regard, as muſt properly be due to ſo great a Majeſty as God is, when their own reaſon might prompt them to it;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:36404:153"/>ſince it naturally concludes for obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſs and ceremony to be due to men, ſuitable to their worth and grandeur in the world. Nay, will not theſe very perſons themſelves, who are ſo ſcrupulous in giving bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God (and ſo loth to uſe care in compoſing Prayers, or to joyn in thoſe that are compoſed to their hands) when they deſire, and expect, kindneſs from men, uſe more than ordinary ſawning expreſſions, and bend their bodies into the moſt obliging poſtures, to advance their deſigns, by pretending a large inward reſpect, which they thus endeavour outwardly to expreſs? And can they really think that the great God ought to have leſs honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, when we petition him for the largeſt Boons, and greateſt Kindneſſes, that can poſſibly be beſtowed upon the Sons of men, even ſuch as will render them as fully happy as their natures, in perfection, are capable to receive? Let any mans reaſon judge in this caſe; And let him make a fair appeal to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; And, upon a juſt retirement, and examination of the matter, (if he puts not a bar againſt his own conviction) he will yield, that a tribute ought to be
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:36404:153"/>paid, by the bodies of men, as well as their ſouls, unto that infinite Being, which made both: And, conſequently, he muſt condemn the worſhip of thoſe who, to ſupport their Schſm, ſeparate their very ſouls from their bodies; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man themſelves, to ungod the Deity; Pay more reſpect to a man on Earth, than to the Supreme Lord of the whole Univerſe, and crouch to his Footſtool, when yet they will not bow to his Throne.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>I Proceed now to a Second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby we prove, that thoſe who, under the pretence of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reformation, ſeparate from us, whilſt they yet live among us, do not pray to God in ſuch a manner, as is ſuitable to his Attributes, their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the object of their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the infinite diſtance that is betwixt their Maker, and themſelves; Becauſe their prayers are, commonly, a very rude indigeſted heap, raſhly conceived, and uttered, extempore; Fraught too frequently with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and nonſence; And haſt, too often, becomes the cauſe of blaſphemy alſo. And how, indeed, can it well be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? When their principle, will not give them time to think, nor mind, well, what they utter? So that if, at any time, they ſail betwixt theſe rocks, and daſh themſelves againſt neither, the wind, and tide, are their only friends; and their ſafety is not owing to the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:36404:154"/>ſteeridge of the Pilot, nor to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to their own pains, and skill, when they allow not themſelves time to employ either. But, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their pretenſions to the Spirit, (of which I ſhall hint ſomething before I end) which advances their rudeneſs, into perfect Blaſphemy; If, praying extempore, they are at any time me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical, and faultleſs; 'tis owing to their good chance, and fortune; And they have an eſcape when they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no pains at all for it. But when <hi>David</hi> was bartering for the threſhing-floor of <hi>Araunah;</hi> and for Oxen alſo, for a burnt Sacrifice; nay, the very wood to kindle the fire; all which, he might have been preſented with for nothing: <hi>David</hi> refuſed ſo Royal a gift; And his reaſon, as himſelf expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, was, <hi>becauſe he would not offer burnt offerings unto the Lord his God, of that which ſhould coſt him nothing,</hi> (2 Sam. 24. &amp; 24.). But, theſe bold men, with whom, to our ſorrow, we have to do, confidently preſent to Almighty God, that, in which no pains were taken in the compoſure; Only a tatling, and talkative Service, ſtuff'd with little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides gibberiſh, and impertinency, that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:36404:155"/>others who conſider what, and to whom they offer it, cannot, without falſhood and irreverence, join with them in; But the halt, and the blind, are their common Sacrifices, and ſtrong lungs the beſt Altar, on which theſe oblations are made: Yet all this they think to ſmother, when they are kindled into paſſion, and fury, in the obſcurity of thoſe phraſes, and length of thoſe ſentences, in which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to offer their comon ſupplications unto God; And they expect the joint conſent of a Congregation, to what they never heard of before; Nor could they underſtand when it was uttered: For their raptures ſo muffle up their notions, and both are ſo mix'd with their petitions, which they wrap in Clouds, and obſcure Metaphors, that the meaner ſort cannot underſtand them; But ſigh and groan, they know not why. And the more conſidering part, that are not blind, have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect ſuch Religion, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and promoters endeavour with ſo much care to ſecure from a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and ſtrict examination. All that I admire in it is, how they can be dark at noon-day, and mount out of ſight
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:36404:155"/>on a ſudden, and extempore? Unleſs, whatever their pretenſions are to quickneſs of invention, they ſtudy ſuch unuſual expreſſions, deſignedly, to amuſe, but not to inform the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men. As <hi>Cotta</hi> in <hi>Tully,</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> (<hi>de nat. Deor. lib.</hi> 3.) <hi>Quae diceret intelligi noluit.</hi> That he would not have what he ſaid to be underſtood. But in prayer to God, when 'tis made vocal, men are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to declare their wants, and petition for relief; And this, eſpecially when any Community joins in it, ought to be managed with an honeſt plainneſs, without any myſterious riddles, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal language, or petitions wrap'd up in mourning Metaphors, as if they were to be buried amongſt the Dead; or any other <hi>Coptical</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> expreſſions, that are difficult to decipher, and much more to be underſtood; For theſe are things that as well baffle the minds of the ſimple, as, too frequently, vail the hypocriſie of him, that makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; Nay, very often, amuſe thoſe of better underſtanding, ſo that they are not able, with any judgment, to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> at the cloſe of all: Nay it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards alſo, and, too frequently, deſtroys
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:36404:156"/>that faith which ought to be earneſtly contended for, and ſafety preſerved pure, and unſpotted. For it's as eaſie, and indeed attended with leſs difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to introduce a ſtrange Creed, by uſing this unbounded liberty in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it is by an unſtinted latitude in preaching; and to inſinuate into mens minds, either old or new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Hereſies, by a frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of thoſe things that tend to their promotion, or eſtabliſhment, in our prayers to God; When the ſouls of thoſe, that join in the devotions, are very intent and open to receive what we ſay, with greedineſs and deſire; Eſpecially, when men are buſied in raiſing their affections to their utmoſt height; There 'tis not hard to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce falſe Doctrine into the belief of others; Which, like a falſe ſtory that, by frequent relation, comes at laſt to be received as true; Not only by the hearers, who are eaſily impoſed on; But he, that tells it, having ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it, forgetting that he once knew it to be falſe, at laſt thinks it to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. Nay, in prayer, where a falſe point in Religion is miſted, and wrap'd up in a petition; 'tis affected, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:36404:156"/>ſwallowed with the petition: And more eaſily digeſted, than if it were declared in an <hi>Homily,</hi> or Sermon: Becauſe, in hearing Sermons, men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their judgments, more than their affections: But, in prayer, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are uſually more buſie than their underſtandings. And that it is very common with thoſe extempore men, that take upon them to conceive prayer in a Congregation, to inſinuate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in their petitions, is ſo manifeſt to all obſerving perſons, who have been preſent at ſuch meetings, that a perſon of any judgment at all, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly judge of the opinion of the gifted Brother that prayeth, by his Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Petitions, and Thankſgivings to God. And then, where people are led by the authority or examples of thoſe, whom they embrace for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; (which in many things the common multitude muſt, and in moſt points it is notorious in many of our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts) what they uſe in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſpeeches unto God, muſt needs obtain a greater reputation with them, than what is only addreſs'd to men: Becauſe they then think their Miniſters to be moſt ſerious, cautious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:36404:157"/>too; This, therefore, was warily, and exceedingly well, provided againſt (after the extraordinary operations of the Spirit ceaſed) by the Council at <hi>Laodicea;</hi> (<hi>Can.</hi> 18.) where the Fathers Aſſembled injoined their Churches to uſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, or form of prayer, both Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Evening. And in the fifty ninth Canon of the ſame Council, it was Ordained, that the vulgarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which were the labours of perſons, who had not ſufficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in theſe things; or any Books, that were not Canonical, ſhould not be ſung, or read in the Churches: Where alſo for mens ſatisfaction againſt the Papiſts, in this matter, you may find the Titles, or Names, of thoſe Books, which the Council then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as Canonical. And, in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levitan</hi> Council, (<hi>Can.</hi> 12.) it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that thoſe Prayers, and Offices, which were approved by an Aſſembly, or Council, ſhould only be uſed; exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others, in all their publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations: Leſt any thing ſhould, either through inconſideration, or ignorance, be uttered before the people, that might contradict the common faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:36404:157"/>and continued among them. And if the Governours of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in thoſe daies, were ſo Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and cautious in their Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the preſent, and transferring the moſt Holy Chriſtian Religion from their own Age, to the ſucceeding, ſo as nothing might be conveyed to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, but what was Orthodox, and of Primitive conſtitution; And to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate that extravagant itch of men, (which ſince we have found increaſing into a Scabb) who ſtart in their ſleep as if they had gotten Buggs about them, and not only delight themſelves in dreams, but greedily impoſe the notions of their pillows, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of their diſturbed bodies on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; When, upon a more ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, they may juſtly attribute all to fancy, and the moſt unaccountable imagination. If theſe things are ſo, our faith, certainly, is not now leſs precious, nor ought it to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inferiour regard, howſoever it may be deſpiſed by the ignorant, or prophane, nor muſt the Argument of the Council be leſs valued, but more; Since this Myſtery of iniquity, in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating falſe Doctrine, together with
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:36404:158"/>Schiſm, and Rebellion too, in extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore prayer, is mixed with ſo much pride in the deliverer, and ſo eaſily works upon the melted and ductile judgements of the hearers, that both are deceived, (if they are not a little Knaviſh); And, when matters are come to this paſs, I can conclude no leſs, than that, if this be permitted, <hi>the blind will ſtill lead the blind,</hi> 'till we all <hi>fall</hi> together <hi>into the Ditch,</hi> when error and miſtakes muſt lead the multitude, and triumphantly captivate the minds of the ſimple, which every where are the greateſt number. But give me leave, farther, to recommend one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, againſt this extempore, and raſh way of publick prayer, which ſeems to render it unworthy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as much as unbecoming men, who yet pretend to conſider in all things, but this; And that is becauſe, when men offer to the great Majeſty of the Univerſe, ſuch unconſidered, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated devotion, they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the world, that there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle awe and dread upon their minds, of that greatneſs, and power of him, to whom they make their Addreſſes; and it muſt cauſe ſtrangers to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:36404:158"/>on to believe, that the God whom they worſhip, either does not regard what they offer, or elſe has given them a large liberty to talk to him in what manner they pleaſe, without danger or puniſhment to any of them: And what a God he will then be concluded to be, is obvious to every ones conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and inference. What will an Heathen ſay in this caſe, but that if the fear of the Gods introduced Religion into the World; Theſe men, having no fear, baniſh Religion, and the Gods together. For can that perſon own the Chriſtians God, who, in publick, evidences ſo little fear and reverence to him? Can he dread the diſpleaſure of his Prince, or any other perſon with whom he converſes, who values not what he ſaies to him, neither regarding the method or ſignificancy of his words, or the phraſes by which he repreſents his mind? And can any man, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows himſelf time to retire and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with nothing but his own thoughts about him, conjecture, or be poſitive in affirming that any dread of the Divine Majeſty has made due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon ſuch minds, which, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining their Spirits to their own
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:36404:159"/>tongues, ſpeak ſudden and unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated language to him? This muſt of neceſſity (very often at leaſt) be raſh and unadviſed; Not fit to be preſented to ſo great a God, as all deſcribe <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> to be; Becauſe it will very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be accompanied with an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of phraſe, unſoundneſs of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or at leaſt an immethodical, looſe, compoſure. He that does but ſend a meſſage to another, eſpecially if he is placed ſome ſteps above him, will be ſure to regard the perſon of him to whom his errant is directed; And to mind the main buſineſs which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends: How ſtrangely is he concerned (if it be a matter of importance) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his meſſenger ſo well in the affair, that, after he has invented the moſt apt and proper expreſſions he can think on, that may comport with the quality, nay, the very humour, of the perſon to whom he ſends, and has once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to his own ſervant, or another? How frequently will he call him back again, to re inform him? That the weight of his buſineſs may not ſuffer diminution, by any light or unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word; That the meſſenger may not ſpoil his deſign, or the leaſt failure
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:36404:159"/>in expreſſion, or behaviour, obſtruct a compliance? And ſhall mankind, who are ſo cautious in ſecular affairs, have very little, or no, regard to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in which they utter their wants, and petitions unto the great God, <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have our beings?</hi> From whom, alſo, we receive the cauſes of our perpetual ſubſiſtence; Nay, when we are begging, from him, ſuch things as are of a moſt great and everlaſting concernment to us, which, if we do not obtain, we are ruin'd, and damn'd to all eternity? In thoſe affairs that we manage with men, (about which we are ſo very ſolicitous) the greateſt evil that can befall us by any failing, or unfortunate miſcarriage, can conſiſt only in a prejudice to our eſtate, damage to our health, a blot to our reputation, an abatement of our pleaſures, and ſenſual ſatisfactions; Or, at moſt, it can but put a period to our lives, and cut the threads which in a few daies would grow rotten and break: All which things if we did eſcape for that preſent ſeaſon, in which we were in danger, we are but for a little ſpace repriev'd; Becauſe they will ſuddenly periſh of themſelves,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:36404:160"/>when the fatal hour ſnatches us from them, and Death ſummons us to the great Tribunal. And ſhall we think it reaſonable to be ſo careful, and big with conſideration, in the managery of theſe low concerns amongſt men, that our ſecular wiſhes, may obtain their ends; and yet be ſo vain and negligent in relation to the welfare of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls, when we petition the great diſpoſer of all things, for ſuch favours, which are ſo important to us, that, if we fail of their poſſeſſion, when we come to die, (as certainly, we muſt) we ſhall then exchange our abode in this world, for ſuch a torment as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible, and yet ſhall never, that we know of, admit of an end, or relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Certainly ſuch men can have little dread of the Divine Majeſty, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their addreſſes to this Supreme Being, with ſuch ſtrange raſhneſs, and inconſideration: Eſpecially when their petitions include the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their own, and others, ſouls; And are offered to that Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which, alone, is able to grant their deſires: This plainly argues, that neither the value of the one, nor the greatneſs of the other, is much eſteemed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:36404:160"/>by them. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth</hi> (ſaies <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>and let not thine heart he haſty to utter any thing before God; For God is in heaven, and thou on earth, therefore let thy words be few,</hi> (Eccl. 5.2.). And if this Text, by a narrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſubtil interpretation, ſhould be reſtrained to vows only; Yet the reaſon of the thing will be as prevalent in prayer, when men on Earth, ſpeak to the great God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; For the diſtance will be ſtill the ſame betwixt us; And our contempt, and his revenge, no farther off. We muſt not, therefore, be raſh in this neither; Eſpecially when we reflect on the meanneſs of our ſelves, and the greatneſs of that Majeſty to whom we addreſs, and conſider well that reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fear, and awful trembling, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thoſe who worſhip at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, who has life and death at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal: If any thing requires a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſideration, certainly our prayers may command it from us. Nay, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, who aſſumes the Title of a Gifted man, to have the quickeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and the moſt voluble tongue that any among the numerous race of <hi>Adam,</hi> can be preſumed to be endowed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:36404:161"/>with; Yet, conſidering too that the diſpoſitions, and activity of mens minds are very obſequious to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of their bodies; That this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alters with the weather, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers create ſuch changes in them, that a man who is one day lively and brisk, having his apprehenſion quick, j his conceptions nimble, his judgement clear, and does all things with a ſprightly fancy, a ready invention, and utters all with very neat, full, and ſignificant expreſſions: Yet, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, on the morrow, or oftentimes the ſame day, this ingenious perſon is dull and unactive, his faculties do in a manner forſake him, as if his ſoul were earth'd in ſome thick matter, or were about to leave its habitation. I ſay, when we conclude ſuch changes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (as all know it by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) we muſt alſo yield that, if the time of prayer then happens, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and indecency muſt frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the matter, method, and phraſe too, of thoſe who utter their unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated inventions. But beſides, theſe indiſpoſitions of our bodies, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our minds; The cares and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which raiſe commotions whilſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:36404:161"/>we remain in this world, that relate to Oeconomy, Trade, and converſes with others, become ſuch as unſettle our minds, and render our thoughts vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and unfix'd; So that our ſouls are not in temper for the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; But are raging and foaming, like the Sea in a ſtorm: Our conceptions, and thoughts, become as nimble, as the ſwifteſt arrow; We ſhoot at one mark, and hit upon another, and haſten from the firſt object, to a ſecond: And, when we are in this condition, like a running ſtream, paſſing from one place to another; How unfit we muſt be to keep our thoughts, and conceptions to any one Theme, to invent matter, and ſuitable words to expreſs it in, any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that will allow himſelf time to conſider, may eaſily determine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aſſiſtance from another. Now private prayer, 'tis true, might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd till our troubles and diſtempers were over; And time, or phyſick, had reduced our minds to their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, by withdrawing the cauſes of our indiſpoſition, and diſtractions: But our publick devotions, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily appointed at certain times, and ſeaſons, cannot admit ſuch prudential
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:36404:162"/>remedies: And then, perhaps, the hours of prayer, in a large Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may come upon our gifted men when they have theſe troubles, fits, or diſeaſes upon them; and what will be the conſequence of theſe things, one that has but half an eye may diſcern; For the people muſt either be openly diſmiſs'd without any publick ſervice at all, or they muſt offer unto God, what is unfit to be preſented unto men, and all muſt ſuffer for the perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of one man. But this does not happen amongſt thoſe who uſe a Form, and Liturgy prepared for them, becauſe a Miniſter, although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indiſpoſed, may read it before the people; and though his own mind may be ruffled and diſcompoſed, yet the people, if they pleaſe, may be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, and devout. And to confirm this charge in matter of fact; as I think no man, who, in publick, has uſed <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> and conceived prayer, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this obſervation upon his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; So I have often, in the late times, and ſince too, heard perſons, who were addicted to this <hi>extempore</hi> deluſion, begin their addreſſes to God Almighty methodically, and well,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:36404:162"/>whilſt they have been informing him what he was, and what they were in themſelves; and yet the prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have arrived at the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either through wearineſs of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other infirmity, has been fraught not only with weakneſs, and indiſcretions, but, with what ſeem'd to me to be a great deal worſe; unleſs myſtical nonſence may demonſtrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and turning in a Parentheſis ſo long, that the firſt half ſentence was forgotten, and had nothing, in the end, to join to it, becomes an ornament to a petition: Now what awe and dread of the Divine Majeſty can poſſeſs ſuch men, who preſent to him ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, uncivil, and nonſenſical pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Nay, how ſuitable ſuch deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to the God, whom we all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worſhip, I willingly leave to all ſober and wiſe men, ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; And I hope the Adverſaries to our eſtabliſhed method of addreſſing our ſelves to God in publick, will never ſo far deſert themſelves, nor depart from their own Policy and Craft, in provoking any of our Church, to inſtance in particulars; Since they well know, that there is more than
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:36404:163"/>enough evidence to be had. I have heard of a perſon who was accounted a man of no mean gifts (before Major <hi>Weir's</hi> ſtaffe bloſſom'd), who, when he had a view of his own prayer, taken by another from his own mouth, on a Faſt-day, would not believe, without great difficulty, that he ever uttered it; But when he was convinced by ſuch a teſtimony, as he could not with any modeſty or reaſon refuſe, he was preſently abaſh'd, and, for the future, betook himſelf to a ſafer method. However, if men conſider what has been ſaid upon this point; that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of this nature, almoſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to <hi>extempore</hi> prayers, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſuitable to the Great God, nor any way comport with his Nature, and Attributes, who is a Being Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Glory and Perfection; The meaneſt perſon, and the loweſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may reaſonably determine, and, without a prompter, eaſily judge in this affair.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>I Shall now go on to a third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the prayers of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, as being unſuitable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, their own dependance on him whom they adore, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſproportion betwixt the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and themſelves; Becauſe they are, frequently, fill'd with Tautologies, and vain repetitions. And the matter of fact cannot be queſtioned by any that have been ſtrict, or looſe, obſervers of thoſe crude and indigeſted prayers, which have proceeded from the mouths of theſe <hi>extempore</hi> devotioniſts, who have undertaken thus to be the mouths of others, what ever forms they might reſerve for themſelves. But our bleſſed Saviour gives a moſt grave and ſerious caution to thoſe who are admitted to preſent homage, and worſhip to the great God, who is the Father of us all: <hi>When ye pray</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>uſe not vain repetitions, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:36404:164"/>do,</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.7.) And though Chriſt might ſpeak <hi>Syriack</hi> at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; yet the Evangeliſt, from whom we receive the prohibition, whoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage becomes the Original unto us, by whom alſo our Saviours words and actions are conveyed to poſterity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving written in <hi>Greek;</hi> we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of what is, in the Text, forbidden, either by what is tranſlated <hi>vain repetitions,</hi> or from the cuſtom of thoſe Heathens, who are ſaid to uſe them. The word uſed by the Evangeliſt, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>When ye pray, do not ſpeak as</hi> Battus <hi>did;</hi> Now, though <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> explains it by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſpeaking much;</hi> yet, the Text, even in the prime ſignification of the word, prohibits all frequent repetitions of the ſame ſenſe and language; as one <hi>Battus</hi> did, from whoſe name, part of the compounded Verb is taken and tranſlated into the Text, who made long Hymns full of Tautologies, he being a very idle and empty Poet. As to what <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> mentions of another of the ſame name, who had an heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſtammering, in his ſpeech, delivering ſuch thick and ſwift
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:36404:164"/>language, that it was difficult to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him; this could be no cauſe of the prohibition of our Saviour: For, this, being only a natural infirmity, and not any careleſs, or affected, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, cannot be the foundation of this caution: and it is rejected by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit himſelf. Secondly, We may more fully underſtand what is here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by a brief reflection upon the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Heathens in this matter: For, (ſayes the Text) <hi>uſe not vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, as the Heathens do:</hi> Now the Heathens (as may appear from their Tragoedians) were wont, many times, in their worſhip, to make repetition of the ſame words; eſpecially of the names of that God which they prayed unto: And they conjectured alſo, that by how much the louder and more ſhrill their ſpeech was, ſo much the more ready would their Gods be to give them audience, and to return an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to their petitions. To this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom does <hi>Elijah</hi> ſeem to allude, when he ſpeaks Ironically to <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prophets, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.27.) <hi>Cry aloud, for he is a God; either he is talking, or he is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, or he is on a journey; or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, he ſleepeth, and muſt be awaked.</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:36404:165"/>Now, the prayer of the Separatiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived <hi>extempore,</hi> he delivering thoſe things and words, that a quick fancy, and ſudden invention, prompts him to, it muſt needs be, that from the nature of ſuch worſhip, he will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to uſe theſe prohibited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions: For, where matter, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, yea, and expreſſions too, are not before hand ſtudied, and compoſed, and put into ſome decent order, the memory cannot firmly retain what has been before uttered, when the fancy and invention has all along been ſo ſtrictly imployed; which is evident from this; That a gifted man, who ſpeaks <hi>extempore,</hi> cannot, afterward, remember his own prayer, or give any tolerable account to men, of what he has, before, ſpoken to God: So, that 'tis a thouſand to one in this attempt, but ſomething, both in matter and phraſe, will often be brought upon the ſtage again; and ſeveral petitions eſcape from the mouths of ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary pretenders, that have, more than once, been preſented before. For, their prayer being wire-drawn into one length; or delivered in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and uninterrupted chain of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:36404:165"/>and expreſſions, that muſt not admit of any large Chaſms, or long intermiſſions, but one thing muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cloſe at the back of another; how can it be, conſidering humane frailties, and indiſpoſitions, but through the defect of preſent and ready invention, there muſt be ſome large gaping ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; or elſe barrenneſs muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the repetitions of what has gone before? Nay, how often have we heard, <hi>Lord, Lord; and we pray thee, and we beſeech thee,</hi> and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to ſupply the want of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to draw a covering over inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertent and incoherent thoughts of the man, who pretends to be much gifted in this affair? So that then, he is fain to ſtop gaps in ſtead of making a new hedge; he coughs and ſpits, in the room of a full ſtream of language, and ſeems to be like a Pump when the water is going away with an hiſs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great hollow noiſe, with little ſenſe or ſignification: And like the Heathen Prieſts that worſhipped <hi>Baal,</hi> who, from morning till noon, cryed out, <hi>O Baal! hear us,</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.26.); and very probably, to as little purpoſe, whilſt there is no voice, nor any that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:36404:166"/>anſwers: Or elſe, like thoſe mutinous <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſtirr'd up by the ſubtilty of a <hi>Silver-ſmith,</hi> with an argument drawn from the defence of their Trade, who, for the ſpace of two long hours, cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 19.34.). And whether ſuch a worſhip, when ſtrong Lungs become the bellows, to blow men up, that they may vent themſelves in tautologies and repetitions, and broken ſentences, when they pretend to utter a continued prayer, is fit to be offered to the Supreme God, and to be preſented, in ſuch looſe petitions, to him by the hands of a glorious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Redeemer, let any, that are not reſolved to be prejudiced againſt any reaſoning in this affair, and are not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid or wilful to a Proverb, conſider firſt, and then, in Gods name, let them judge. But leſt we ſhould meet with an uſual recrimination, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; I muſt obſerve here, what is eaſily inferr'd from a tranſient refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the former expoſition, that all repetitions are not vain; nor ſuch as are prohibited by our Saviour: But, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> expreſſes it, he forbids, <hi>ſupervacaneam, &amp; inanem ſtudio affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:36404:166"/>verborum copiam:</hi> A ſuperfluous, and an empty affected plenty of words: when we permit our language too much to overflow our ſenſe, and abound in expreſſions, as the Heathen did, becauſe they <hi>thought to be heard for their much ſpeaking:</hi> They conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, it ſeems, that ſuch plenty of words, might cauſe the deafeſt of their Gods to hear them; when they pelted them with vollies of thick language; and that they would better underſtand the matter and ſubſtance of what they offered in their petitions, and more eaſily remember all, when things were ſo frequently inculcated by repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But alas! the Heathens worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one ſort of God, but the Chriſtians preſent their prayers to another. And as mens notions concerning the God whom they worſhip vary, ſo will their worſhip vary too, if they act ſuitably to the arguments and inferences of their own reaſon. If men, therefore, who ſo buſtle, in this world, about the manner of addreſſing themſelves to the Deity, would but impartially ſtate the nature of that Being, to whom they devote their acts of Religion; and then compare their worſhip which they
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:36404:167"/>give him with thoſe Attributes by which they deſcribe him, and enquire diligently what is worthy of him; we need not have ſo many diviſions, where all worſhip the ſame God, about thoſe things that are not reveal'd, nor fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſturbances about thoſe that are; ſince it cannot (without blaſphemy) be ſuppoſed, that God would require worſhip from Chriſtians, that did not correſpond to his Eſſence and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, when he hath declared, that <hi>he will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> and that he ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. But, to let this paſs; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the prohibition of vain repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this will no conclude againſt the repetition of ſome prayers, and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Liturgy of our Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are uſed either in divers Services, which antiently had their different and ſucceſſive ſeaſons allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; or in the ſame, upon ſome new, and emergent, occaſions, being placed at the end of divers readings, and where opportunities and reaſons preſent themſelves for returning to the ſame ſupplications and thankſgivings. And there can be no argument to prove, that God delights in the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:36404:167"/>of phraſes, where the reaſon and matter of prayer and praiſe are ſtill the ſame; nor any cauſe why we ſhould endeavour it; unleſs it be to ſhew our copiouſneſs of language, or to tickle the ears of a wavering mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which is alwayes too much given to change. Theſe divers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and intermixed readings, are the cauſe of the repetitions of the Lords Prayer, and the invocations of the Perſons in the Trinity apart: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deficient in all our prayers, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our imperfections, by one of divine authority and compoſure, which is more compleat and full; which, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we pray, we are commanded to uſe. And, indeed, our Lords Prayer is as Salt to ſeaſon our Sacrifice, leſt it ſhould not be acceptable to the noſtrils of him, to whom all our devotions are directed. And till the 118th and 136th <hi>Pſalms</hi> are expunged from the Sacred Canon, the force of an objection which is raiſed upon no ſtronger a foundation, will not be able to throw down, or batter, the antient Order and Uniformity of the Church of Chriſt. For although men may inſtance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions in our Service, they are not of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:36404:168"/>the nature with the Tautologies of the Heathen, nor ſuch vain reduplications as our Saviour prohibits: No, nor yet to be parallel'd with the extravagancies of their prayers, againſt which, I have here preſumed to argue: Becauſe ours are made with judgement, and due rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for them; the matter being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and the returns not more frequent, than the offering of the ſame prayers and praiſes ought to be: But theirs, are needleſs, becauſe they admit not the ſame juſtification, are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of barrenneſs, and want of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe of careleſneſs and inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; and ſerve only to ſupply the room of matter and ſenſe with aery words, and empty ſounds, and, in the place of true and ſubſtantial harmony, they ſubſtitute indecency, and jarring diſcords.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <p>I Proceed now to a Fourth Reaſon that we have againſt the prayers of our <hi>extempore</hi> Separatiſts, and to prove, that they are unſuitable to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory of that God, whom they pretend to ſeek; and that is, becauſe they are unprofitably long, and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly protracted, in their publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; ſo that ſome, who had not their whole Sermons ready, have ſpent the Sands in the Hour-glaſs, that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them, by this knack of enlarging their <hi>extempore</hi> prayer in the Pulpit, adventuring to ſpeak to God without premeditation, when they durſt not ſo ſpeak to the people. But, to let this paſs at preſent; (which yet I know to have been too true). We uſually peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Princes, and perſons of great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in as brief and compendious a form, as the matter of our deſires is capable of, that it may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within as narrow a compaſs, as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:36404:169"/>ſignificant and full expreſſions can repreſent it. And ſhall we ſuppoſe, the great God, to be of a leſs Majeſty, than an earthly King; or leſs ſagacious and apprehenſive; or not to merit as much reſpect, as Princes and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, who are his Deputies and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents? Will not the ſame; and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reaſons too, that incline us to make brief petitions, to the advanced, and underſtanding, perſons in this world, prevail with us, to uſe a decent brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and curtneſs, in our language, when we make our requeſts known to God? Eſpecially, ſince we all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he foreſees the wants of the world, his Providence being over all his works) having infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo that nothing can eſcape him, and ſuch an eſſential and perfect good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that there is not need of much thetorick, to incline him to relieve the neceſſities of mankind, when, with due reverence, and hearty affection, they call upon his Name, and now, under the Goſpel, through the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Son, which cauſes his very bowels to yearn. He that knoweth the ſecrets of mens hearts, needs not many words to inform him of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:36404:169"/>things they want, and what will be moſt convenient for them. This is the argument which our Saviour urges againſt inordinate cares for the things of this life; even <hi>becauſe our heavenly Father knoweth, that we have need of theſe things,</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32.) And <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the forementioned Text, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.) adviſes men, that, becauſe there is ſo great a diſtance and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt God and themſelves, therefore, when they ſpeak to him, <hi>their words ſhould be few:</hi> and he backs his counſel with this argumentative ſimilitude, That as <hi>multitude of buſineſs makes men ſubject to unquietneſs and dreams; ſo a fools voice is known by a multitude of words:</hi> As if that were the inconſiderate ſacrifice of fools, which he made mention of in the firſt Verſe, when exuberant expreſſions make up the oblation. He, that has made but ſlender obſervations, may eaſily diſcern, that the moſt glorious God of all the world took great care, in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his worſhip, to difference it from the Heathen Idolatry; and would never permit their Groves to have a communion with his Sanctuary. Now, it was a common cuſtom, among them,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:36404:170"/>to draw out their prayers into a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as well as unprofitable, length; though they did it by reiterating the ſame expreſſions, upon no new reaſon at all; but becauſe of the falſe notions of God, which they had imbibed, that made uncouth impreſſions, on their underſtandings. For they conjectured, that, by how much the louder their voices were extended, with ſo much the more certainty, would their Gods hear them; and by how much the more frequently the Names of their Gods, and their petitions were repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo much the deeper impreſſions would they make, to cauſe their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, incline their wills, and make them to remember to return down ſupplies to them. Now, ſuch reaſons being very unſuitable to the nature of the Chriſtians God, who underſtands all things by an inſtantaneous intuition, and cannot poſſibly forget to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; he needs not any thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his memory; much leſs vain and prohibited repetitions. It follows, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that 'tis very diſagreeable to his glorious Attributes, for men to pelt him with a long, tedious, continued prayer, beyond what is fit to, repreſent our
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:36404:170"/>wants, enflame our zeal, and raiſe our affections to a decent height; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate our humility and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on him, and to quicken our devotion, to a Being, ſo tranſcendently great and diſcerning. Hence, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, forbidding the fruitleſs tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of the Heathen uſed in their ſolemn and moſt earneſt devotions, commands his Diſciples, not to be like them; as well becauſe <hi>they thought to be heard for their much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inng,</hi> as becauſe the God, whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are directed to worſhip, knows the things they have need of before they ask him; And then he directs them how to pray in a ſhort and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive form, which all his Diſciples were to uſe and imitate, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.). But yet as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaies, (<hi>vid. Epiſt.</hi> 86. <hi>&amp;</hi> 118.). God will be intreated, he will be as it were compell'd by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arguments, and overcome by a certain importunity; this is a good violence, which our Saviour himſelf has incouraged men to by the example of the <hi>importunate Widow,</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.). The deſign of which parable, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, was to incourage men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to pray, and not to faint.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:36404:171"/>The ſame thing we are alſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do in the Apoſtles writings; where we are bidden <hi>to continue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to watch in the ſame,</hi> and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in this duty, and the like: Which injunctions, and exhortations muſt, at leaſt, obtain ſo far, as to bear up our hearts and expectations in our prayers, and rebuke all deſponding thoughts; that ſo when we petition our Maker, for any bleſſing that may relieve our neceſſities, we may not be diſheartned by reaſon of any or his moſt wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions; Nor, be diſcouraged, or diſcontented, to an omiſſion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, becauſe we have not a ſudden return to our prayers; But that we may ſtill repeat our duty, and be the more inſtant, by how much the more we may ſeem to be denied; Unleſs we receive an apparent ſignal of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, either at the matter, unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs, or manner of our addreſs; which, becauſe we cannot eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, eſpecially if, upon examination of the reaſon, grounds, and rules of prayer, drawn from the object to whom our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are directed, from the condition of our ſelves, who are petitioners, or from precepts, exhortations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:36404:171"/>too, which we find exhibited in Sacred Writ, our judgements corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond to our petitions; and, upon ſcrutiny, we can find no fault in them, nor any defect in our utterance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. There is no way therefore left, but in all our prayers, to imitate him who was the moſt Religious man, and the beſt compoſer of petitions to God, that ever the world yet ſaw; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Jeſus himſelf, the Mediator of the new Covenant;</hi> who, when he was in his dreadful Agony, being ſenſible of what he then felt, and fearing alſo what he muſt endure when fixed upon the Croſs, <hi>prayed that this Cup might paſs from him;</hi> Yet 'twas with ſubmiſſion to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, which he then ſignified in words as plain, as they were full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; <hi>Nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> (Matth. 26.39.). But all this may yet be obeyed, without any long and tediouſly continued pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where protraction in the ſpeaker, too frequently renders it ridiculous, and brings an indiſpoſition, and wearineſs, to moſt of the devotioniſts. For men may beſtow not only daies, but nights too, in this moſt great and ſolemn du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer, (in which, by obeying
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:36404:172"/>the inferences of reaſon, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of Religion, we enjoy ſo large and comfortable a privilege) by running through a ſhorter courſe of devotions, conſiſting of many Collects, and premeditated forms, which may include the matter of all our petitions; and, after little intervals of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, returning, with earneſtneſs, to the ſame again. For prayer, certainly becomes our duty, and our dependance upon God prompts us to it, more to demonstrate our own humility, and devout reliance on the mercies of God, than to inform him of our neceſſities, &amp; troubles, or by our Oratory to incline him to hear us: And therefore that muſt be the beſt, and most compendious, way of worſhip, by which are anſwered the great deſigns, and ends of prayer: And, without doubt, when our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affections are, with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ardency, and moſt vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, imploy'd in this duty, it beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates our own vileneſs, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt confidence in, and love to, God. Now this is more vigorouſly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, when we uſe ſuch methods as may leaſt weary and tire our Spirits; And 'tis eaſie to judge, whether ſhort
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:36404:172"/>Ejaculations, and brief Collects, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with ſome other various offices, accompanied with ſome little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions that give breath to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, the intention, and affections of our minds, be not more conducing to the expediency of this affair, than a long, continued, and uninterrupted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: For men may find, (if they will both try and judge fairly) that this latter way dulls the phancy, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the invention, darkens the object, (as the eye is dazled with gazing too long at the Sun) and diſcompoſes the whole man; and makes us more ready to ſleep than to pray. But, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer method, where confeſſions, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thankſgivings, are excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and orderly intermix'd, and follow each other, ſo that the entrance upon one, is a relaxation from the other, and we ſtay not too long at a time on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and theſe call upon us for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent poſtures of our bodies, and divers affections and tranſports of our minds; Here we receive eaſe and refreſhment, and conſequently, muſt needs be better fitted for a longer continuance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distraction, than if all were put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one uninterrupted chain of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:36404:173"/>expreſſions. And therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> informs, (<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 121.) That the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi> Brethren were wont to make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent prayers, <hi>Sed eas tamen bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimas, &amp; raptim quodammodo ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas:</hi> But they were very ſhort, and darted forth with a ſudden quickneſs: And the reaſon which he gives for this is very appoſite to my preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Leſt the attention of the mind, which is now vigilant, and lifted up, (abſolutely neceſſary to one that prays) ſhould be dull'd and vaniſh by a longer ſtay, and more tedious conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: Nay, ſhort prayers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſharp darts, that ſoon pierce the Skies, and enter into Heaven. To commend theſe, St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> upon the Sixth of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> tells us, that our Lord, in prohibiting vain repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the cuſtoms of the Heathen, ſeems to him to forbid long prayers; Long, (ſaies he) not in time, but in prolixity of expreſſion, and multitude of words. And, indeed, when we have leiſure to conſider what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaies in the forementioned Epiſtle, <hi>Hoc negotium plus gemitibus, quam ſermoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus agitur, &amp;c.</hi> That prayer is made more with ſighs, and groans, than in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:36404:173"/>words and expreſſions, and that it is evidenced more by weeping with our eyes, than by breathing at our mouths; we need not be ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of ſuch patch'd, and thereby lengthened prayers, to a continued five hours adventure: Becauſe this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only a nimble invention, with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility of language, placed in a ſtrong and ſturdy body; but it ſtifles affection, and renders watchfulneſs it ſelf drowſie in thoſe, that are to join in it; and keeps him that utters it only awak'd, becauſe he cannot ſo well ſpeak in his ſleep; and the whole, when done in this manner, demonſtrates confidence, but not devotion. Nay, it ſeems not a little ſtrange to me, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhould be ſo taken, as they are, with theſe long-winded gifts of ſome men; Since we know what kind of Cattle they were, that firſt <hi>devoured widows houſes, and, for a pretence, made long prayers,</hi> (Matth. 23.14.). But, indeed, 'tis not a multitude of words, but ſincerity of mind, and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtneſs of affection, that will prevail with God to be propitious to us: For (as the ſame Father has it) <hi>much ſpeech is one thing, but a continual daily affection
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:36404:174"/>another.</hi> Now this raiſing our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their proper objects, inflaming our deſires, and teſtifying our humility and dependance on God, being great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and ends of our devotion; and thoſe prayers being beſt compoſed, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered to the Divine Majeſty, are moſt capable to cauſe theſe effects: It follows, that ſuch a tedious length in a continued and uninterrupted chain of petitions, not well accompliſhing the great ends and deſigns of prayer, cannot be ſo fit to be offered to God, <hi>who requires our beſt and moſt lively ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> and will not accept another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, when (to borrow an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>we have a Male in the Flock.</hi> Add to this, Finally, what ſtrange confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men uſually make, who are forced to lay hold of every advantage to gain a Topick, to lengthen what they call prayer; When he is accounted the moſt powerful man that remains long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at this exerciſe: The gifted perſon's own ſins (as has been remark'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are uſually preſented for the faults of the Congregation, and they muſt permit him, whom they account to be their Miniſter to tell lies in behalf of the people, if all his Auditory are
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:36404:174"/>not guilty of the ſame particular crimes with himſelf. 'Tis true, indeed, that a general confeſſion of Commiſſions, and Omiſſions, all mankind may join in; Becauſe, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God,</hi> (Rom. 3. 23.). Or, in the true and ſecure words of our <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, We have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done; And have done thoſe things which we ought not to have done.</hi> But to extend a ſolemn and publick Confeſſion, to the length of all the Commands of God, and all thoſe faults of men that we can reduce to ſuch comprehenſive Laws, together with their circumſtances, and aggravations; And for one man, in publick, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as the Mouth of all the people, that we have broken all theſe Commandments of God, <hi>both in thought, word, and deed;</hi> when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps few, or none of thoſe, in whoſe names he preſents ſuch Confeſſions, have actually, and plainly, without a figure, committed <hi>murder, adultery, theft,</hi> or the like; is to render devout men more vile than they are; to give (as I have hinted) to the very Heathen an opportunity both of ſcorn, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:36404:175"/>To tell a lie in the face of the Sun, and ſolemnize a falſhood in the preſence of God, who, <hi>being a God of truth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> cannot but hate all lying in the mouths of others. And, beſides, what an impudence is this to utter ſuch things in our confeſſions to him, <hi>who is our Maker, and our Judge,</hi> that are not only doubtful, but untrue? In which, conſidering people cannot join with others that make them, becauſe they muſt acknowledge guilt, before they have yet committed the Crime; and condemn themſelves by their own confeſſion, when neither their own conſciences accuſe them, nor does God himſelf convict and judge them. Such inventions the evil Spirit himſelf may not only allow, but recommend to the world; Becauſe they too frequently not only teach men how vile the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor is himſelf, but how many wayes Gods Commandments may be broken by them, and inſtruct the people in new waies of offending God which they were ignorant in before. Now whether ſuch ſervice is fit to be offered to the great God, whom the Chriſtians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; Who can, and will, ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf on thoſe? that thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:36404:175"/>affront his Majeſty; <hi>who cannot lie,</hi> but is a Being of infinite ſplendor, and perfection, and delights not in the blemiſhes <hi>of the halt, and blind,</hi> who, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a God that is Omniſcient, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſincerity and truth of mens Confeſſions, and to what ends, and deſigns they are uttered; Who knows the conveniency, wiſdom, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of our devotions, and the original and height of all the ſubſtance, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our prayers, together with all the parts of them; I ſhall leave to all wiſe and thinking Religious men to conſider, when they are unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and retired, by themſelves.</p>

               <p>I Shall, in this Chapter, urge another reaſon againſt the ſtrange <hi>extempore</hi> prayers of our Separatiſts, to evidence that their publick devotions are not ſuitable to the greatneſs and glory of that God, whom they pretend to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; And that is, becauſe, generally, thoſe whom they admit to be the mouths of their Congregations ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their prayers in ſo careleſs and looſe a manner, as if they had more thoughtfulneſs about that by which they endeavour to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to men, than that by which they attempt to approve themſelves to God. Otherwiſe what means the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and reiteration, of expreſſions, when they petition for the ſame things? The Great God cannot, certainly, be rendred more propitious, or receive a more convincing and prevailing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to grant relief, and a ſupply, to mens neceſſities,, becauſe various phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:36404:176"/>expreſs their wants; And every time they have occaſion to renew their petitions for the ſame favours, they do it in different language, and method: Becauſe 'tis not the rhetorick, or copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of words, but the affection, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and piety of mankind, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Merits, and Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, that now incline the great God to hear our prayers, and grant our requeſts. Yet various phraſes do, indeed, pleaſe and captivate the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of many weak and unſtable men, and give advantage to the deſigns of Schiſm, by ſome mens licenſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take a liberty in ſuiting their prayers to the temperament and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of ſuch perſons, whom theſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Shepherds intend to fold among their ſeparated Flocks; And therefore is it, that they love not the language of the Church, which is grave, and manly, and eaſie to be underſtood; but they adapt their expreſſions to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tones, and particular, mimical, and ſurprizing geſtures, by which they captivate ſilly women, or melancholy men, whom they find poſſeſſed with more paſſion, than underſtanding. This I ſuppoſe to have been the great
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:36404:177"/>reaſon and motive why the Papiſts, reſolving, by all poſſible means, to rend us in pieces, firſt introduced this way of <hi>extempore</hi> prayer, (far different from that mental prayer of Mr. <hi>Creſsy,</hi>) which a late Authour ſo Jeſuitically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes). As may more largely appear to any candid Reader in a little Book, Entituled, <hi>Foxes and Firebrands.</hi> But if ſome ſuch ends, by which they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratifie the Papiſts, were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Maſters of our private Aſſemblies, who Lord it over the faith of ſome men, and the Authority of others, to draw as many as they are able into the Net which they have ſpread in the midſt of the waters; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially over ſuch Fiſh, as carry mony in their mouths: If they did not (in plain terms) endeavour to make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Church, that their own may, at laſt, appear to be the greateſt, by whatever, under the pretext of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, conveighs delight by that vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety which pleaſes the generality of mankind; Why ſhould they not as well Preach <hi>extempore,</hi> as pray ſo? In their Sermons, I am ſure, they were wont to uſe all the art, and ſtudy that they could, accommodating their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:36404:177"/>and expreſſions too, that their pains might bear proportion to their Auditory, and the faſhion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thoſe, who were in greateſt repute amongſt them: And I cannot divine what might be the cauſe of this different regard to prayer, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs they had more care in thoſe ſpeeches they directed unto men, than they took about thoſe which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto God: For they ſeem to me to have no greater promiſe of an aſſiſtance from Heaven, in relation to the one, than they have alſo with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the other. Do they think that Text, in the Eighth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> proves effectually, that the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſts them in their prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle has delivered, that, likewiſe, <hi>the Spirit helpeth our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; becauſe we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought,</hi> &amp;c. If it be well weighed, and conſidered with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, it will only evidence our Saviours moſt earneſt and wiſe Interceſſions for us, in Heaven, by the holy Spirit, which alwaies accompanies him; The ſupport of our minds under the greateſt preſſures we meet with in this world; Or, moſt, that the Scripture, being
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:36404:178"/>dictated by the Spirit, has given us directions for the proper heads, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>er of our prayers, and reſolves, ſtill, by ſome benign and ſecret influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (which we are not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to others) to proportion our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and elevate our minds to the importance of the concernments we pray for, and the greatneſs of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to whom we petition. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (if I were the greateſt Critick in the world) I ſhould alwaies abhor the founding any neceſſary Doctrine upon the ſignification of a word in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; which words we know (as in prophane Authors) are frequently equivocal; and reſtrain'd according to the compaſs of that matter in which they are: Therefore I ſay nothing of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor of <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, neither. But if men are reſolved, for ends that will not ſerve them at the day of Judgement, to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many things that may be ended here, to make theſe words, againſt their own will, in contradiction to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience of all thinking men, that are not either knaviſh, or mad, to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:36404:178"/>expreſs a promiſe of ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aſſiſtance from the Spirit now in our inventions of matter, and words in prayer unto God. They may as well rely, (if they are pleaſed with ſuch waies of interpreting Scripture) upon that promiſe of our Saviour made to the Apoſtles, to enable them to preach and write the Doctrines of the Goſpel; (<hi>John</hi> 16.13.). <hi>Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> And becauſe there were Divine inſpirations at the firſt, which were neceſſary, if God would deliver a Law by the mouths, or writings of any ſelected out of the race of men; Our gifted Brethren may, if they pleaſe, take occaſion from the 10th of St. <hi>Matthew, verſ.</hi> 19th, and 20th, to attempt any thing without premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſtudy, (and then to be ſure we ſhould be hard enough for them): Since our Saviour there informs his Diſciples, <hi>that they need take no thought what, or how, the ſhould ſpeak; becauſe it ſhould be given them in that hour;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> when they might have occaſion.). And he uſes an Argument to raiſe, and to confirm their belief of it; <hi>For it is not ye that ſpeak</hi> (ſaies he); <hi>but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:36404:179"/>of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> And yet I fancy that if our <hi>extempore</hi> men were in the ſame circumſtances, and put under thoſe conditions which this Text ſuppoſes, and were accuſed of ſomething Capital, before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, they would not only ſtudy all waies of clearing themſelves, to avoid the puniſhment, what ever at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of the guilt; And this they would endeavour by all the means that a cloſe conſultation with their own thoughts could poſſibly ſuggeſt, and not only, with ſeriouſneſs, prepare an anſwer to any accuſation of this nature; But, I believe too, they would condeſcend to adviſe with the learned in the Law, that they might (if poſſibly) avoid the Sentence of the Judge. Nay, in ſuch caſes, whether they would fee, bribe, or make the greateſt friends they could, I leave to their own Conſciences, and experience, that I may ſay nothing of making publick commotions, to ſave themſelves. And as in buſineſs of this nature, gifted men are inclined to think that ſuch promiſes of aſſiſtance were only intended for a ſhorter time, and not to reach this preſent age; So though the Apoſtles, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.) <hi>Being
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:36404:179"/>fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, began to ſpeak with divers languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance;</hi> they will ſubmit their Spirits, and condeſcend to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of heads of matter, and modes of expreſſion, when they preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; though they are to ſpeak in no other than their Mother Tongue. Now why ſhould this great care be had in their Sermons to the people, when they uſually have ſo ſlender a regard to what they utter in their prayers to God, if there were no diſtinctions of times and ſeaſons, in relation to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and aſſiſtances of Gods Spirit? (For ſurely Preaching, as well as praying, is an ordinance to continue 'till the Elect are gathered; and that will not be, till the end of the world.) Unleſs they will affirm, and give us too apparent an Argument to believe, that the Spirit has ſo ordered matters, that leſs pains and diligence are to be uſed when we addreſs to God, than when we ſpeak only to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And if any are ſo bold to talk thus, I hate to refute ſuch nonſence, and blaſphemy both together: For it plainly appears, that ſuch men muſt be liable to the ſame rebuke, which the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:36404:180"/>chief Rulers of the <hi>Jews</hi> received from our Saviour, recorded in the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> (Chap. 12.43.); <hi>Who, though they believed on him, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, becauſe they loved the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God:</hi> And, let their ears be never ſo much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, they render themſelves oppoſite to the true circumciſion, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29.). And how far ſuch contrivances may comport with ſincerity, and be diſtant from that Hypocriſie, which has ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woes attending it, I ſhall leave to thoſe, who are concerned, to adjuſt; and content my ſelf with that directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the great Authour of our moſt excellent Religion, has delivered in relation to private devotions, which holds good in publick too, prohibiting all ſiniſter, and hypocritical deſigns in prayer, to gain the praiſes and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of men: <hi>And, when thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou ſhalt not be as the Hypocrites are; For they love to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the Streets, that they may be ſeen of men,</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5.). I ſhall not therefore value at all how I am recommended unto men, if their approbation ſhall
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:36404:180"/>render thoſe actions that gain it, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and odious unto God. He that is called to that Honourable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though deſpiſed, Office of a Miniſter, in the true Church of Chriſt, muſt neither fear the frowns of men, nor the malice of Devils; and no body can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow greater ſlurs or indignities on our vocations, or perſons, than our receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacred Character may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn us to expect. We know it is an Employment unacceptable to the guilty, to tell men of their faults, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargue their errors, <hi>and to put them to open rebuke and ſhame;</hi> nay, by chance ſometimes, to their very faces: And, in doing this, we cannot but expect to bear ſome ſhare in our Saviours ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Who, though he was the beſt Preacher of the Goſpel, was both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, whipt, and Crucified. <hi>Now the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor is the Servant above his Lord;</hi> And 'tis no more than he has forwarned us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, <hi>if we are hated of all men for his names ſake.</hi> Nay, were it not that the great God himſelf eſpouſes our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, when truth remains unſhaken on our ſide, by his Providence, making way for deliverence from our enemies;
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:36404:181"/>that he that deſpiſeth us, deſpiſeth Chriſt himſelf, <hi>and he that deſpiſeth him, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him,</hi> alſo, <hi>that ſent him</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.). And that not only promiſes of temporal deliverances, or at leaſt ſupports under the preſſures of our adverſaries, but an eternal reward is alſo granted to him that continues and perſeveres unto the end (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22.): We ſhould have been quite ſwallowed up by thoſe ſtrange children, <hi>whoſe teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their tongue a ſharp Sword.</hi> And we ſhould have, as long as we are permitted to live, work nough cut out for us, not only to tire the moſt active and indefatigable minds among us, but even to diſturb our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and break our hearts. For there is nothing almoſt in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but what either the wit or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of men, has render'd doubtful; And the perverſe wranglings of one man with another, have made that a Subject to diſpute upon, which was at firſt deſigned to unite the whole world, in the ſtricteſt bonds of Catholick cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by a compleat and uniform pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and practice of one Religion. And though there is no ground either in Scripture, or Antiquity, to found
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:36404:181"/>theſe rude, indigeſted, long and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical prayers on; Yet their Patrons, that they may continue to delude the people, do, like men in a Shipwrack, lay hold of any plank to ſave them. And therefore (notwithſtanding, as they manage their prayers, 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent blaſphemy to aſſert it) they intitle the moſt Holy Spirit of God to all their looſe, inſipid, and moſt ridiculous prayers, as if he were the very inditer of them, or at leaſt a wonderful, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, coadjutor in ſupplying, by an immediate impulſe, an <hi>extempore</hi> man with matter and expreſſions. Yet I know not well (although I am able, upon a private occaſion, to pray, in this manner, by my ſelf) upon what they can ground their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar confidence, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expectation in this matter; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Primitive examples of men inſpired, when the infancy of the Church more neceſſarily required it, which, being extraordinary, can be no common precedent; Or upon ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. chap.) <hi>I will pray by the Spirit, and I will ſing by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing by the Spirit,</hi> and the like. Now whatever aſſiſtances
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:36404:182"/>were at firſt given either for a ſign to confirm the Authority of the Goſpel, or the Commiſſion of any that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the World; Or elſe to enable ſome to inſtruct others, or to pray with them, in thoſe more early times of Chriſtianity; they are no more to be expected now the Goſpel has been ſo long planted, than that gift of tongues which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſaies, <hi>that he will ſing, or pray, or bleſs by the Spirit.</hi> And that this is the plain meaning of the forementioned Chapter, is very obvious to any that will peruſe it: And that the Apoſtle (though himſelf had extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences in theſe matters) does not incourage <hi>extempore</hi> devotions, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuke diſorders among thoſe, who, having the miraculous gift of tongues, prayed in ſtrange languages to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they underſtood not, has been already concluded, upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Chapter, in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe. But, becauſe it is urged by <hi>Fanaticks</hi> againſt us, in another ſence than that in which we urge it againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as if they would give theſe a deliverance by a new interpretation; I will ſpeak a little upon it again; to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:36404:182"/>ſhew that praying by the Spirit, in this place, cannot countenance <hi>extempore</hi> prayer; Nor has it any more relation to it than <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> has to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh;</hi> Nay, as 'tis now uſed, not ſo much neither. The Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in his <hi>Critical Diſcourſe of the work of the Holy Spirit in Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. has an excellent reaſon, (<hi>pag.</hi> 19.) why the Holy Spirit does not formally pray; <hi>Becauſe all prayer, whether Oral, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative, is the act of a nature inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to that which is prayed to:</hi> So that I ſuppoſe theſe mens prayers, whatever, in the mean time, they ſay to us, are not ſo immediately dictated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as if he that uttered them, were only the pipe through which (without a Metaphor) the waters, or the wind flow: But 'tis ſome kind of aſſiſtance which they ſtrive for, to help their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and expreſſions, in prayer, beyond a benign influence upon us to raiſe our graces and affections in our devotion: Which, if they underſtand themſelves, they are very loth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the ſence of it to others. However, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot juſtifie them in this place, is plain from the fourteenth Verſe of the Chapter. <hi>If
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:36404:183"/>I pray</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the gift of tongues, which is an effect flowing from the Holy Ghoſt, prayeth.). But my own apprehenſion of what, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this extraordinary gift, I utter, is no argument to prove that it is advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous unto others; <hi>For</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is unfruitful; i.e.</hi> to thoſe who hearing, ſhould have joined with me. And then it follows, <hi>I will pray by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and I will pray by my underſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> That is; <hi>when he did pray in an unknown tongue;</hi> he would, by his underſtanding, ſo interpret it, as to render the prayer intelligible unto others. So that <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> here, is oppoſed to <hi>Spirit; i.e.</hi> the ſpeaking as thoſe do, who have not the gift of divers languages, when they deliver the conceptions of their minds; to an utterance of our petitions in an unknown tongue; And it concludes, indeed, againſt the Publick Service of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> and juſtifies our own in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> (As I have already ſhewed). But it can neither ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Enthuſiaſt, nor detract from the worth, or reputation, of a well compoſed Liturgy. And that this is the true meaning of this Scripture, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:36404:183"/>the real oppoſition which is here made of <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>underſtanding;</hi> and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, appears, plainly, from the naked words of the nineteenth Verſe, without any Paraphraſe upon, them: <hi>For</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>I had rather ſpeak five words with mine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that by my voice I may teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> And though St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s interpretation of the whole, does not in every part agree with this; Yet he expounds <hi>Spirit, by the gift of tongues.</hi> But if men will ſtill evidence their vanity by defending their extravagancies by Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, (which have been won from them, as often as they have trump'd them up to the world) and urge that in the twelfth of <hi>Zechariah;</hi> Where God promiſes <hi>to pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, the Spirit of Grace, and of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> &amp;c. They will gain but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle countenance from hence, for their irrational and looſe way of worſhip; Though, as a neat Commentator of their own deſcants upon it, it ſhould be poured out, as by whole Pailfuls. <hi>(Trapp in loc.).</hi> For nothing can be
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:36404:184"/>concluded from this Text, but that the time ſhould come in which God would, by his benign operations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much favour to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they who were hardned, through their own infidelity, to the affronting, and Crucifying the bleſſed Jeſus, ſhould ſo relent for their former wickedneſs, that they would pray to God, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for their pardon, when they came to be convinced that the very perſon, whom they put ſo death, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Impoſtor, was, indeed, the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> And ſo it no more concludes, that the Holy Ghoſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed under the Goſpel to dictate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſions to all thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly pray; than it proves all Saints, under this diſpenſation, to be perfect <hi>Jews</hi> that crucified their Saviour. Nor can all the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> in the world, make either out from this Text. Nay, ſuch Doctrine can no more be founded on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Zechariah;</hi> than that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould alſo dictate matter, and words in Preaching too, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Sanctified mens Sermons, as much the word of God as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, can be infer'd from that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:36404:184"/>in the ſecond of <hi>Joel;</hi> where God ſaies, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all fleſh, and your Sons and your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall propheſie:</hi> Since, this was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled on that eminent day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> viſibly deſcended on the Apoſtles, to enable them to ſpeak divers languages, and to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the propagation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, of the Goſpel; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly 'tis limited by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.16.). If men will ſtill trifle with the Scriptures, let them allow alſo women to be Preachers as well as men; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the promiſe, it is ſaid, <hi>that Daughters, as well as Sons, ſhall Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> 'Twill only (as 'tis uſual with ſome men) prefer the Old <hi>Teſtament</hi> to the <hi>New,</hi> and ſet a Prophet, and an Apoſtle together by the ears, that we may judge the advantage to which we pleaſe, as he gratifies either our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or our intereſt. But ſuppoſe our <hi>extempore</hi> men ſhould flie from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to the ſucceeding Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians; as I know not but they may, when they find any thing that makes for them; and tell us that all this worſhip, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt, is juſtifiable by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:36404:185"/>of the Primitive Chriſtians, who, living near the times of our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, muſt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Doctrine, and their practice better than we, who live in an Age ſo far off; and quote ſome paſſages from the Ancient Fathers to juſtifie their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant devotions now. I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, (1.) We grant that in the firſt times of Miraculous operations, before the Chriſtian Church was well ſetled in the World, the Spirit did as well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate prayer to ſome, for the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as it inſpired ſome to deliver the Chriſtian Doctrines and faith, that they might be derived downward to poſterity: But all this ceaſed, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the reaſons of it ceaſed, when the Canon of the new Law was compleated, and Knowledge, and Parts, became the fruits of liberal education, and the Spirts co-operation with human induſtry. (2.) That the Fathers give no countenance to this <hi>extempore,</hi> wild, way of prayer; And the later Patrons of this conceived me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, when they urge any expreſſions from them, are fain to ſqueeze a few particular paſſages hard, either by a falſe rehearſal; Or elſe by Criticiſing,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:36404:185"/>and large interpretations, they draw their words off from the ſence which the ſubject matter, and coherence of the place, does willingly afford them. (3.) That this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this affair is diſclaimed by a late <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> writer, who is eminent both in venting, and darkning, too, theſe <hi>extempore</hi> prayers; And almoſt as ancient as any now living, in defending them: Nay, and he has reaſon too, when the contrary opinion (as he ſaies) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes oppoſite to his own experience. But, to give him his due, he admits Scripture in this Controverſie; And would have men to believe, that all the commands for prayer in the Sacred writings, are ſo many laws to injoin their own <hi>extempore</hi> way and method: Yet, though he adventures at ſome promiſes, I cannot find that he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with the commands, ſo as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate any one to <hi>extempore</hi> prayer; Though he is very good at Criticiſm and Inference. But natural Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, when riveted by cuſtom, skulks ſo within a man, that, though poſſeſs'd with it, he does not know it; And 'tis ſuch another thing, as what the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar call <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which a man
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:36404:186"/>may ſometimes be charg'd with, when he yet pleads not guilty. As I have heard of another great Writer, whoſe Aphoriſms, when Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had peruſed, preſently replied; <hi>This man is an</hi> Arminian, <hi>but he does not know it.</hi> (4.) If any will defend theſe conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publick prayers from Antiquity; I wiſh they would alſo put other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Controverſie betwixt them and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon the ſame trial, and permit the Government of the Church of Chriſt, to be alſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this way. Yet (Laſtly) theſe things are here ſet down, not becauſe we have any cauſe of fear, from what can fairly be urged for <hi>extempore</hi> prayer out of any Ancient Author of undoubted Credit, (the quotations having fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been anſwered.) But more eſpecially, becauſe they are juſt now explain'd in the <hi>Second Part of certain Caſes of Conſcience reſolded, concerning the lawfulneſs of joining with forms of Prayer in publick worſhip.</hi> The view of which, ſince the compoſure of this ſmall Diſcourſe, has cauſed me to omit ſome things here. But becauſe there is a place uſually quoted out of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> (<hi>Apol. cap.</hi> 30.) that I find has
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:36404:186"/>been conveyed as low as the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> and the Sectaries have gotten it by heart; I ſhall preſent the Text, with the Notes upon it, which are enough to ſatisfie reaſonable men, that they plainly miſtake the meaning of it. For this Father ſhewing how the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians prayed for the health, and ſafety of the Emperors; That they called on the eternal, true, and living God; and, looking up to Heaven with hands ſpread forth, becauſe innocent, and bare headed, for that they were not aſhamed; <hi>Denique ſine Monitore, quia de pectore oramus pro omnibus Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, vitam illis prolixam, imperium ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourum, &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, without a Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, (or Promptor, ſaid the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>) and, out of the breaſt, or by heart, the Chriſtians then prayed for all Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that they might have a long life, an happy Government, a ſafe Palace, ſtrong Forces, a faithful Senate, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt people, a quiet World, and what things ſoever are the deſires of Mankind, and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And from the expreſſions of <hi>ſine Monitore,</hi> and <hi>de pectore,</hi> the Schiſmatick framed an Argument, as he was able, for <hi>extempore</hi> prayer. But in one thing I cannot but be of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius</hi>'s
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:36404:187"/>mind, and of <hi>Rigaltius</hi>'s in another, with reference to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Text. The former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs, from the practice of Chriſtians here mentioned, that apt and decent Ceremonies are to be uſed in prayer, ſince <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes (even when he was making an Apology for them) 'They lifted up their eyes, to ſignifie a faithful, though hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, confidence in the God, to whom their prayers were addreſſed. They ſpread out their hands to teſtifie their innocence; and were bare-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to let the naked truth of their Religion appear, and thereby profeſs'd ſuch a vertue, and piety, and truth too, in their faith and manners, that they need not cover their heads, (which was a token of ſhame) nor vail their faces; no, nor hold their Hats before them neither, ſince they had no cauſe to bluſh for their Religion, nor to be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt. Theſe, it ſeems, were, in thoſe dayes, Symbolical Ceremonies. But, I have reaſon, alſo, to take ſome hints from the latter Interpreter of this place in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to prove, that another thing is meant by <hi>ſine Monitore,</hi> and <hi>de pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore,</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:36404:187"/>than what the Separatiſts kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly ſuggeſt; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Monitor here, denotes a particular Officer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, called by that title, and was one, who, in their publick devotion, read to the people the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſet down in writing, that there might neither be an omiſſion of words, or any expreſſions uttered prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. He mentions alſo another Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to attend to this; and another <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> who called on the people, not to be too loud. Now, the ſecond of theſe, ſeems to be a perſon, who kept the Catalogues of the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities, to whom ſeveral Petitions and Services were directed, and might, for ought I can find to the contrary, have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of the written prayers themſelves. This, ſome would have to be a kind of <hi>Nomenclator,</hi> who ſignified the Names of the Heathen Gods, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Deities, to whom, at any time, addreſſes were to be made, ſuitable to particular occaſions, and wants. For theſe, like the Canonized Saints in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not equally to be invoked for all things; but one for this, and another for that: Now, this <hi>Cuſtos</hi> (in <hi>Rigaltius</hi>'s Note, which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:36404:188"/>he refers us to <hi>Pliny</hi> for) hearkned and inſtructed the Monitor when he failed, and brought forth, or delivered the Book, and declared the Name of the God to be invok'd; that ſo they might not abſurdly pray to <hi>Mars</hi> for Patience, to <hi>Bacchus</hi> for Wiſdom, or <hi>Apollo</hi> for Wine; and the like. Now, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, addreſſing themſelves only to one God, could not be liable to ſuch miſtakes; and therefore need nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> nor <hi>Monitor;</hi> becauſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe had made their prayers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, ſo that all had them perfectly by heart, and therefore joyned with them with their very ſouls; and were not ſo ignorant in their daily devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if they never heard their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before; or were, every day, to change their prayers and their God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But, if the ſtrength of the Separatiſts argument ſhall lay in the reaſon why, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes, they needed not this Monitor, becauſe they prayed <hi>de pectore,</hi> and ſo needed not ſo much as a form to direct them; this can no more be proved from this place, than that becauſe they prayed <hi>ſine Monitore,</hi> the Chriſtians then had no Miniſter to direct the people, either
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:36404:188"/>by premeditated, or conceived, prayer. The ſenſe of the place therefore muſt be this, that the Chriſtians needed not a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> or a <hi>Monitor,</hi> neither any to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, to what particular God they ſhould pray, ſince they owned but one; nor any to put them in mind to pray for the Emperours, becauſe, this they were willingly inclined to; and did it from, or with, all their hearts: And, this is a very probable account of the place; becauſe, <hi>Tertullian</hi> here, making an Apology for the Chriſtians to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> his Son, ſhewes, how heartily and ſincerely they prayed for the Emperours, and that their Religion could not diſturb, but advantage their Government, Becauſe, praying thus heartily for them, they could not but wiſh, and act for, their welfare: And this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment certainly holds among all thoſe who are ſincere in Religion; But there is no fence againſt a Phariſee, or an Hypocrite; only we muſt remit all ſuch to the judgment of that God, to whom they pretend to pray. I ſhall conclude this with a ſmall animadverſion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advice to thoſe who are ſo pleaſed with <hi>extempore</hi> prayer, that they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:36404:189"/>deliver themſelves, in this duty, without a ſerious and orderly preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. That they would impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, whether, when their minds and ſouls are ſo intent on the invention of matter, and words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, they can ſo well reflect: on the object of their prayer; eſpecially ſince our quickeſt and moſt retired thoughts cannot admit of divers objects at the ſame moment! And if not; then whilſt men are inventing matter, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to fill their prayers, it may be worth inward reflections upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether whilſt they are buſie to find out their devotions they do not, at the ſame time, loſe their God? And now I have written all that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoughts ſuggeſt; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove, by the ſtrongeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which my ſlender abilities are able either to collect, or invent, that the worſhip of the Separatiſts (as 'tis commonly managed) is not ſuitable to the Being and Attributes of the God whom they pretend to adore; the dependence of Mankind on him; nor the infinite diſtance, and diſproportion that is betwixt him and themſelves: Which may, perhaps, add ſomething
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:36404:189"/>to the fortification of the members of our own Church, if it cannot cauſe ſome ſad reflections in the better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd part of thoſe who, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, have ſeparated from it: And it may give ſome rebuke to the bold confidence of ſuch men as are not ſo hardned, that they think there is no need of repentance, or that the ſhame which attends it will be worſe to them, than the want of the thing it ſelf; and check the rude preſumption of thoſe who, to exalt themſelves, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too large a familiarity with their Maker. And now I ſhall trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with very little more; being conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my ſelf, how much I have already tired any that has had patience to read this Diſcourſe quite through: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe extravagant and very lofty men pretend to inſpiration in ſuch matters as theſe; as if the holy Spirit dictated matter and words, to all Saints when they thus pray <hi>extempore.</hi> If it be true, I acknowledge my ſelf to have blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in this Diſcourſe; But if it be falſe, (as I verily believe it is) then they themſelves have blaſphemed the <hi>Holy Spirit of God.</hi> And to make a judgement in this caſe, I ſhall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:36404:190"/>treat the impartial Reader, who I ſuppoſe is come thus far with me to our journeys end, (1.) to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if what I have ſaid, be argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to convince him, then the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my remains, in the preſumption of our Adverſaries, on their own ſide. (2.) If their prayers were thus inſpired they would be equally Canonical with the Scriptures; For what made the Scriptures a Rule of life, but becauſe they were given <hi>by inſpiration from God?</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.). And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> informs us, that <hi>holy men of God ſpake in old time, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (2 Pet. 1.21.). And though men have been, <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners,</hi> ſpoken unto in the Old, and New, Teſtament; <hi>yet it was God who delivered his meſſages unto men,</hi> (Heb. 1.1.). And becauſe he inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Writers of the Old Teſtament, and the New, to a delivery of what their words and writings have preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the world, therefore we receive them as the Oracles of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to manage our lives by them. God Almighty has no where declared what Books are Scripture, and what not; But this we learn by ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:36404:190"/>as convince us that the men that wrote them, were inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now could theſe mens prayers, of which we now diſcourſe, be proved to be dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, they would be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valid with the Scriptures: For, as in the proof of the truth of the holy Scriptures, if the Hiſtorical part be proved to be true, the Doctrines, that are included in the Hiſtory, will, by the ſame evidence, appear true alſo: So if we allow the confeſſions, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thankſgivings, of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be inſpired, the propoſitions on which they are founded, and all the Doctrines inſinuated in them, will be admitted as an effect of the inſpiration alſo; and then what inſpired Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies ſhould we have? Nay, there would not only be additions to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Canon, which St. <hi>John</hi> is quoted by themſelves to have prohibited; And Doctrines alſo, and prayers too, that have no foundation in that Sacred Writ, which has been derived as a compleat rule for ſundry Ages: But we muſt receive ſuch large Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes, that they would not only ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all Popiſh traditions, though
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:36404:191"/>they ſhould ſuperadd thoſe of the <hi>Jews;</hi> But it might be ſaid, in the words of the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> (without any, or but a little, <hi>Hyperbole</hi>) That if they were written, the world it ſelf could not contain the Books, becauſe the prayers of theſe are ſo various and long; And beſide this, it would level the Prophets, our Saviours, and his Apoſtles prayers to the rude, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and extravagant conceptions which our natural Enthuſiaſts utter in thoſe, which all men call <hi>extempore,</hi> prayers. (3.) If theſe men had that extraordinary aſſiſtance from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or ſuch an inſpiration to which ſo bold a pretence is made; Then the Spirit of God muſt be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered inconſiſtent with it ſelf; Since it would frame tedious and long prayers contrary to that plain fulneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient brevity, which we find in thoſe that are recorded in Sacred Writ, as delivered by the Prophets, or Apoſtles, or even our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And then the examples menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Book of God, will ſeem to be changed by extraordinary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his own Spirit. (Laſtly,) Conſider that, notwithſtanding all our
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:36404:191"/>
                  <hi>extempore</hi> mens, pretenſions, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cannot be the product of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dictating to the ſpeaker, matter and words; Becauſe this ſudden, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Knack, is plainly diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by thoſe that know, and can uſe, it, alſo, as well as themſelves, to be the effect of quickneſs of invention in one who remembers Scripture Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; who has a voluble and ready tongue; and 'tis gained only by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe, together with little arts in the compoſure: At ſeveral times 'tis done by changing the places of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, or altering the method, ſo that it cannot eaſily be obſerved by the vulgar; And all is but like the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a Military Company of men, whole front, or reer, ranks or files, are quickly altered by one, or few words of Command. And this great gift (as 'tis called by ſome) advances or grows weak, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decay of natural abilities, the abatement of knowledge, or the ſprightlyneſs and activity of mens parts; the ſtrength of memory, or the infirmity of it; the volubility of ſpeech, or the heſitations, and ſtops in it; and the practice or diſuſe of this <hi>extempore</hi>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:36404:192"/>way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we may add boldneſs, and baſhfulneſs, fear, and a good aſſurance, and the like. Hence a Right Reverend Prelate, not long ſince deceaſed, when, before he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at this honour, (though he was alwaies a very great man) he was pleaſed to write concerning this gift of prayer, was willing to ſubject it to the rules of Art; that ſo the Holy Spirit of God in all its infuſions into good men, might be ſuppoſed only to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize their judgments, and affections, that they might be both ſanctified and raiſed; which may as well be in forms of devotion, as in conceived and <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> prayers. And now I have done with all that I intend at preſent to write on this Subject: But if any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall find an objection which is neither, in this Diſcourſe, obviated in the ſtate, nor already anſwered in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances; I muſt then refer him to ſeveral <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſundry Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> very lately exhibited to the World; and more yet that are to come forth; and when they receive a full anſwer, I may, perhaps, be convinced by it: Although the moſt that I have yet ſeen,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:36404:192"/>ſeem to me to have prickles in them, that, for their Brethren (as they call them) to attempt a reply, will render them like things gnawing <hi>thiſtles;</hi> Yet men may adventure at what they pleaſe, and I'll aſſure them, it ſhall be all one to me, whether <hi>Don Quixot encounters a flock of Sheep, or a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill.</hi>

The ſame may we alſo ſay of thoſe perſons, whoſe pretenſions are the higheſt, in underſtanding the deepeſt myſteries of Chriſtianity; That they cover the brighteſt Sun in a Cloud, and render the plaineſt things obſcure, and find My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in words, that, in themſelves, are moſt obvious to the minds of men, eaſily repreſenting their own meanings; ſo that to diſcover the foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, needs no more than the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of that rubbiſh, which, by myſtical men, is caſt upon it. Yet, by ſuch means, ſome turn the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into Gibberiſh, and cauſe it to ſpeak in an unknown tongue; either
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:36404:194"/>by their own miſapprehenſions, or an induſtrious veiling of thoſe words that were at firſt deſigned to expreſs it: thus converting a plain Religion into more Myſteries, than were to be found at <hi>Epheſus</hi> or <hi>Athens.</hi> Such words as theſe, are Prayer, Conſcience, Faith, Spirit, Gifts, Experience, Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the like. But the matters of our Religion, ought not to be obſcure, becauſe Gods Service is a rational wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1). And therefore, we find this in <hi>Tully, Haec, ſi Deorum ſigna ſunt, cur eſſent obſcurd?</hi> He ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Signs, and Wonders, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from the Gods, <hi>If theſe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>are notices from the Gods, why ſhould they be ſo obſcure and dark?</hi> And, in his ſecond Book of Divination, he proves, that things which are obſcure, want both Grace and Majeſty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it renders any, the moſt holy Syſtem of Religion, extreamly ſubject to the cenſures of men, and liable to be accuſed for cheat and impoſture, when it ſeems to have two faces, may eaſily carry a double name, and is v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under equivocal, or obſcure, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; and the phraſes by which it is exhibited to the world, are miſted, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:36404:195"/>dusky, if they are not quite dark: as if the preſervers of the Myſteries of Religion, like the <hi>Keepers of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Commonwealth of England,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to keep them all unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thus <hi>Theodoret</hi> (<hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 2.) reports of <hi>Leontius</hi> ſtained with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Blaſphemy, <hi>That he endeavoured with ſubtilty to hide his opinion under a dubious and equivocal language, altering the ſenſe of</hi> Gloria Patri, <hi>by changing and interpoſing ſome little Prepoſitions, and Conjunctions, and by rehearſing a part ſoftly to himſelf, (or, what is more probable, totally omitting it) and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part with an audible voice, that ſo he might (although it was diſcovered) avoid accuſation among the Orthodox: And, though he loſt his faith, yet, it ſeems, he was not willing to loſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of</hi> Antioch, I wiſh our Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were free from ſuch left-handed deſigns; (though I believe, there is no danger of their advancing to Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, unleſs we ſhould conclude thoſe to be diſtracted, whom yet we ſuppoſe to be very wiſe). And then their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity might, a little, ſtand in the room of the Ideot; and either excuſe them for mangling and ſpoiling Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:36404:195"/>worſhip, by making Myſteries where they cannot find them; or for inventing folly, in which there is no Myſtery at all; or, at leaſt, excuſe them if they refuſed to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all the Myſteries produced by others. We are all, I confeſs, of the family of God: But, yet, God does not pray with us, though he is the Maſter of this great family; and it would be abſurd, for him to pray unto himſelf. But it may be, that there is a Myſtery in this too. However, ſtrange words, and uncouth phraſes, ſtrike terror and amazement into the minds of Proſelytes, that they may, by this method, be ſoftned and prepared the more eaſily to receive the impreſſions of thoſe principles, which, otherwiſe, upon retirement and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, their free reaſon would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver embrace. And truly, this is an honeſt plea; becauſe, 'tis open, and without reſerve: Though I am afraid, there is a little knavery in it; becauſe, I find <hi>Euſebius</hi> informing us (<hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 4.) that <hi>ſome of the Diſciples of</hi> Marcus <hi>the Magician uttered many Hebrew names, that they might affect thoſe that were newly entred into their ſtudy and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, with the greater admiration and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:36404:196"/>amazement.</hi> In a word, our moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and obſtinate Separatiſts are much of the temper, and deſign too, of thoſe, whom S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> blames in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his firſt Book of the Trinity, who endeavoured to tranſcend all that was created; but being kept down with the burden of mortality, when they would ſeem to know what they were ignorant of, and could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they would, by their bold and reſolute affirmations of their own opinions, they bar'd themſelves from the means of knowledge, chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not to correct: their own perverſe opinion, than to change that which they had aſſumed, and were reſolved to defend. What ſhould I trouble any Reader with what they prop and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what our Schiſmaticks call their Churches? For, ſince they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their own ſucceſſion, they boldly deny any to be neceſſary. And yet <hi>Tertullian</hi> (<hi>de Praeſcript. Haeret. cap.</hi> 32.) ſent this challenge to the Hereticks then, <hi>Edant ergo origines Eccleſiarum ſuarum, &amp;c.</hi> Let them put forth the origine of their Churches, let them turn over the Catalogues of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that ſo deſcending, by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:36404:196"/>from the beginning, they may find, that their firſt Biſhop has had one of the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical men, who hath converſed with, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, the Apoſtles, his Author, and Anteceſſor: For by theſe means, and in this method, do the Apoſtolick Churches deduce and declare their Original. I might, to enlarge my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, alſo inſtance in many of the received Doctrines of the Separatiſts, that are as currant, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, among them; which yet, under the fair pretence of endearing words, and Scripture proofs, wound the Deity in his glorious Attributes, diſturb that bleſſed harmony and peace, and the Politick Government of mankind, which the profeſſion and practice of the Chriſtian Religion does very much help, and conduce to, and therefore is it by the moſt Wiſe God recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and eſtabliſhed in the World. But I ſhall forbear theſe things, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and conclude all, with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> bears (to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row an expreſſion from the ſpawn of theſe men) againſt all prayers that are rude and indigeſted, more full of words, than of ſenſe, and more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:36404:197"/>with long Periods, than matter that may promote hearty devotion: For the Father (in the beginning of his Tract of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> does abundantly condemn ſuch things as theſe, by giving a quite contrary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the practice of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in this particular. Becauſe, after he has given this advertiſement, <hi>That God is a God at hand, as well as a God afar off;</hi> and that, <hi>where-ever a man hides himſelf he certainly diſcerns him, becauſe he fills Heaven and Earth, and ſees both the good and the bad:</hi> This holy Father acquaints men, that when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were congregated to celebrate the Divine Offices with the Prieſt of God, they ought to be mindful, both of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Diſcipline; <hi>Non paſſim ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilare preces noſtras inconditis vocibus, &amp;c.</hi> Not to brethe out our prayers in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid words, nor throw out our petition, which is modeſtly to be commended, unto God, with a tumultuous ſpeech; becauſe God is not the hearer of the voice, but the heart: nor is he to be put in mind of any thing by clamours and outcries, who ſees and underſtands the thoughts of men. And now I have finiſhed this Diſcourſe of Prayer,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:36404:197"/>which, I both wrote for, and preached to, the people, to whom, I have, as I ought, fairly dedicated it. And if others, only to exerciſe their cenſuring talent, ſhall find fault with it, let them, in charity honeſtly mend it; or elſe they may, as aſſuredly they will, Turn the Buckles of their Girdles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</p>

            <head>I deſire here to recommend to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes to which the former Diſcourſe is Dedicated, a few Collections out of a Book intituled, <hi>The Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Presbyterial Government;</hi> By the Miniſters of the Province of <hi>London, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember the 2. 1649.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THey complain, that to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Apoſtaſie ſome were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, that they were labouring for an odious Toleration of all abominable Opinions, as can ſhroud themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Pag.</hi> 103. And that thoſe errors, which were but few in the Prelates time, were now many in theirs. Their note on <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Mark them which cauſe diviſions,</hi> &amp;c. is, that we are not only required to avoid their Doctrines, but their perſons: For proof of which, is quoted 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. ch. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 104.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:36404:198"/>The Doctrine of a Toleration of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions is contrary to Godlineſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a door to <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs. And that all Doctrines, are to be avoided, that hold forth a ſtrictneſs above what is written. And therefore their advice is, that men muſt be Candidates of a Canonical, not an Apocryphal, ſtrictneſs. And where God has not a mouth to ſpeak, men muſt not have an ear to hear, nor an heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>Pag.</hi> 105.</p>
            <p>That Doctrine which crieth up Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the ruin of unity, is contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel. And they conclude with this affirmation; That, certainly, the Government that carrieth, in the front of it, a Toleration of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions, and is not ſufficient to keep the Body of Chriſt in unity, and purity, is not the Government of Chriſt. And again, That Doctrine which is contrary to the rule of Faith, or any duty required in the <hi>ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> or to any petition of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> is not a Doctrine of Chriſt, and therefore to be rejected. <hi>Pag.</hi> 107.</p>
            <p>Nay, they complain that, then, they were an Hypocritical Nation, and the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:36404:199"/>people of Gods wrath, becauſe they had been Truce-breakers, Self-lovers, Traytors, falſe Accuſers, and all under the ſpecious form of Godlineſs; Nay, if any will read over the Book, they will, by their own confeſſions, prove ſome of the wickedeſt people under the Cope of Heaven. We are, ſay they, Proud, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, Liars, Swearers, and forſwearers, Murderers, Drunkards, Adulterers, and Oppreſſors; We have not learned Righteouſneſs, but Unrighteouſneſs, by all the judgments of God: We are worſe and worſe, by all our deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: We have ſpilt the blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament, by our unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving: Nay, after all this long Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of ſins, they tell us that it would be too long to reckon all the particular relative iniquities of the party; of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters, Husbands, Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they conclude this with thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. from the 5th Verſe, onwards; <hi>Ah ſinful people! A people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vid. Pag.</hi> 109, &amp;c. Let God, and other men, now judge out of their own mouths; For 'tis not my buſineſs to judge any man.</p>
            <p>But to go on, a little more, with that
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:36404:199"/>Orthodox Doctrine which this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſſembly there exhibited; They ſay farther, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 119.): That it is the duty of all Chriſtians to enjoy the Ordinances of Chriſt in Unity, and Uniformity as far as it is poſſible; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture calls to Unity, and Uniformity, as well as to Purity, and Verity: And that not only becauſe it is not impoſſible in it ſelf; but for that God has promiſed, that his <hi>Children ſhall ſerve him with one heart, and with one way, and with one ſhoulder:</hi> And for this they quote the Prophets, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> predicting the glorious flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the Goſpel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. As alſo our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviours prayer, <hi>That we may all be one, as the Father was in him, and he in the Father,</hi> Joh. 17.21. That ſo, from the unity and love of his Diſciples, <hi>the world might believe that God had ſent him.</hi> And therefore this Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly concludes, That nothing hinders the propagation of the Goſpel ſo much, as the diviſions and ſeparation of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Profeſſors. Nay, they farther ſay; That if all men cannot come up, in all particulars, to the Uniformity of the Church; Yet they ought to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:36404:200"/>together in what they agree; And to prove this, they quote the Text which that very worthy and Reverend Perſon, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> the preſent Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, choſe to Preach his moſt excellent Sermon from, before the <hi>Lord Major</hi> of this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City, againſt which ſo many pens have been ſharpned and blunted too, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Nevertheleſs, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule; Let us mind the ſame thing.</hi> Nay, they add, alſo, that this was the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians; Which is the very ſame thing which the Reverend Dean endeavoured to prove; And yet men, pretending to the ſame Principles with theſe Provincial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, either as plainly endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſuch things, or (according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>Phariſees,</hi> &amp; Jeſuits) attempt to evade them by face, or diſtinction. The Lord help me, who am a poor ſimple man, when perſons of wonderful, and miraculous, education, and learning, thus talk in and out. Nay, farther, in the matter of forbearance; the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Divines deſire, only, that all things may be tolerated that conſiſt with the fundamentals of Religion, the Power of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:36404:200"/>Godlineſs, and with that Peace which Chriſt has eſtabliſhed in his Church. But to Preach up, or practiſe, that which makes Ruptures in the Body of Chriſt, (I uſe here their own language) and to divide Church from Church, and to ſet up Church againſt Church; and to gather Churches out of true Churches, and to hold Communion in nothing: This (ſay they) we think hath no warrant out of the word of God, and will introduce all manner of confuſion in Churches and families; And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturb, but, in a little time, deſtroy the power of Godlineſs, Purity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Peace of Chriſtians; Nay, ſet open a wide gap to bring in Atheiſm, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Hereſie, and all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore this Provincial Aſſembly of the Miniſters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>London,</hi> concludes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 121. with that deſcription which Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> gives of the miſchievouſneſs, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Schiſm, (<hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.) Schiſm, (ſaies he) is a grievous ſin. (1.) Becauſe it is againſt Charity to our Neighbour. (2.) B cauſe it is againſt the Edification of him who makes the Separation, in that he deprives himſelf of Communion in Spiritual good. (3.)
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:36404:201"/>Becauſe it is againſt the honor of Chriſt, in that, as much as in it lyeth, it takes away the Unity of his Myſtical Body; And (4.) It makes way to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and ſeparation from Chriſt; from whence they conclude that Schiſm is a ſin by all good men to be abhor'd. Nay if we look into <hi>Pag.</hi> 112. we ſhall find that when men ſeparate from what they acknowledge to be a true Church, 'Tis Schiſm: And to ſet up a Church againſt a Church, and, as the Ancients call'd it, Altar againſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; This is the weakning the hands of the Church, hindering the glorious work of Reformation, cauſing the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Houſe to ceaſe, and is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, inſtead of a Reformation. Upon ſuch a diſmal ſtate, and farther proſpect of worſe times, (if any could be ſo) within leſs than a year after the Throne followed the downfal of the Epiſcopal Church of <hi>England;</hi> theſe <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Provincial Aſſembly, thus exhort the people (<hi>Pag.</hi> 110.) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their being humbled for the evils that ſo much abounded, (for which as they ſay, even thoſe in their daies of Reformation the Earth mourned, and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:36404:201"/>the Heavens were black over them) when they had mourned ſeriouſly, every one a part; Their deſire and advice, to them is this; That you would put away the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that is in your hand; That you would be tender of the Oaths which you have taken, and thoſe which may be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you; That you would prize the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, and reverence your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; That you would ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and hate Hypocriſie, and ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That you would receive the love of the truth, leſt God give you over to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. lies; That you would not truſt to your own underſtanding, leſt God blind your underſtanding; That you would conform to the truths you already know, that God may diſcover to you the truths ye do not know; That ye would not have ſuch itching ears, as to heap to your ſelves Teachers, nor embrace any Doctrines for the perſons ſake; That ye would ſeek the truth, for the truths ſake, and not for any outward reſpect; That ye would ſtudy Catechiſm more diligently, &amp; by degrees be led on to perfection; <hi>And let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> Theſe were the excellent exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of a Province of Divines, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Epiſcopal Church of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:36404:202"/>
               <hi>England;</hi> And why ſhould not ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſtructions, and advice be prevalent in this paper, ſince they are tranſcribed from their own? To conclude therefore in the language of this Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, If we are a true Church of Chriſt, (which the late Doctrine of occaſional Communion ſufficiently proves) and Chriſt holdeth Communion with us, why do any ſeparate from us? <hi>If we are the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt,</hi> do not they who ſeparate from the Body, <hi>ſeparate from the Head alſo?</hi> If the Apoſtle calls thoſe diviſions in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> by the name of <hi>Schiſms,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10) Though Chriſtians there did not ſeparate into divers formed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of ſeveral Communions in the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper;</hi> May not your Seceſſion from us, and the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you cannot join with us as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſetting up Congregations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Communion be more properly called Schiſms? Eſpecially when Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were gathered out of Churches, as this Provincial Aſſembly there complains. If any are willing to ſee more of this, let them peruſe the Book; <hi>And the good God give us all a right underſtanding in all things.</hi>
